,T,"and over two, so there's your line right there.",T,,,(students working in groups)
,T,"and finally number ten, we're at three, the slope is negative one. perfect.",T,,Explore,(teacher going from group to group)
,S,cool.,F,,Explore,
,T,"so now, all you guys have to do +...",F,,Explore,
,S,answer the questions.,F,,Explore,
,T,is to answer these questions. okay?,F,,Explore,
,S,(silent),F,,Explain,
,T,the best you can.,F,,Explain,
,S,on this piece of paper?,F,,Explain,
,T,on your piece of paper.,F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,T,on your own piece of paper okay?,F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,T,"all right, how we doing here, guys?",T,,,
,S,I don't know...,F,,,
,T,what's the ruler for?,F,,,
,S,oh.,F,,,
,T,look at this. just from now on make sure to straighten out these lines and keep going.,F,,,
,S,all right.,F,,,
,T,and are you labeling? that's number one...,T,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,number two.,F,,,
,S,no that's number three. I forgot to do number two.,F,,,
,T,"okay, wait a minute. number three is concerning me. you ready?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"let's try this again real quick. all right. it's three plus seven, right?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"so when I put in... let's just start with zero. when I put in zero, what's three times zero?",F,,,
,S,zero.,F,,,
,T,plus seven is?,F,,,
,S,seven.,F,,,
,T,why did you put negative seven?,F,,,
,T,what's zero plus seven?,F,,,
,S,well I started [//] oh.,F,,,
,T,"Chris, let me take a look at your table for three. how come you're not standing up to Raymond here and saying, hey man, look I got the right answers.",T,,,"(teacher addressing students who aren't working together, low motivation)"
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"all right, your table is correct. you've got to believe in yourself. all right?",F,,,
,S,I didn't know it was right.,F,,,
,T,you guys gotta start working better together and comparing answers.,F,,,
,T,all right?,F,,,
,T,"Ben, I'm worried about you man. what are we doing here.",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,put away the book.,F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,Explore,
,T,"and Chris, you need to work with your normal partner here a little bit better. and compare answers.",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"so I mean, if you would have compared answers, guys, you would have seen on this table here, right +...",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"that, hey! someone must be making a mistake because we're getting different answers here, right?",F,,,
,S,mm hm.,F,,,
,T,"so, either correct yours, or if you want, you can trust Chris. I would trust Chris' to be honest.",F,,,
,S,all right.,F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,S,I used twos... three...,F,,,
,T,right. now did you have to go by twos?,F,,,
,S,I don't. Did I?,F,,,
,T,"Wait a minute, isn't this just a regular number three?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"so on these kind, I always told you just use, like, zero, one and two, right? you didn't have to go by multiples or anything because there's no fraction to divide by. you see?",F,,,
,T,"all right guys, let's see what we can do here.",T,,,(teacher begins addressing whole class)
,S,"Mister Ormsby? all right, never mind.",F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,T,can I interrupt the whole class?,T,,,
,S,(chattering),F,,,
,T,shh. okay.,F,,,
,S,I guess.,F,,,
,T,"five, four, three, two, one, zero. shh. now please listen.",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,okay?,F,,,
,T,"the thing is I have to be honest. I'm getting a little worried, maybe a little frustrated here, just because I could see that some of you have some serious weaknesses. yet, you have people either across from you or right next to you, your own partner that seems most of the time. have the right answers, yet you're not even asking them. so, guys, I ask you, starting right now, is check your work with your partner's work. work together. all right, this is not an individual kind of assignment here. does everything I say make sense so far?",T,,,
,S,yes Mister Ormsby.,F,,,
,T,okay. now let me just give you a heads up. we've got roughly what? twelve minutes left in class?,F,,,
,S,"um, xxx.",F,,,
,T,okay. I want you to keep doing what you're doing. if for whatever reason you actually get to the last page...,F,,,
,S,"yeah, we are at there.",F,,,
,T,"and you've answered these questions to the best of your ability. now obviously today we have no time to discuss it, okay. we're going to pick this up again on Monday, but if you happen to ask these questions...",F,,,
,S,monday?,F,,,
,T,"yeah, we're back on Monday, right?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"when we... after you answer these questions, if you get that far, please make sure you do this quickwrite. all right. which simply means all I want you to do is be honest with yourself and with me and just sit there for the remaining time. write a minimum of two paragraphs, okay, on what we've learned today. what you've actually learned today. okay?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"those of you that aren't at this stage, don't worry about it yet. at about, let's say, four or five minutes, I'm going to make all of you do it anyways.",F,,,
,S,"you're so generous, Mister Ormsby.",F,,,
,T,so please keep working wherever you are. I'm still walking around. ,F,,,
,T,yeah?,T,,,
,S,I didn't do...,F,,,
,T,don't worry about that until Monday.,F,,,
,S,(chattering),F,,,
,T,we'll catch up on Monday. all right? let's focus on this.,F,,,
,S,we got done and we... like right there.,F,,,
,T,"all right, Ashley?",T,,,(students resume working in groups; teacher goes to next group)
,S,"yeah, um... okay, I don't get these two.",F,,,
,T,all right. does anyone in this group...,F,,,
,S,no.,F,,,
,T,understand what to do here?,F,,,
,S,"no. because, like, there's different numbers. which one would we use?",F,,,
,T,okay. all right.,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,okay. now you want to use slope and y-intercept or do you want to make tables?,F,,,
,S,tables.,F,,,
,T,"seems like tables are the way to go here, right?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"so let's go there, all right?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"first of all, Ashley, that's a negative five thirds, isn't it?",F,,,
,S,"oh. wait, no, the fastest...",F,,,
,T,"okay. so now, if I plug in zero, guys, Brandon, watch. if I plug in zero, what's negative five thirds times zero?",F,,,
,S,zero.,F,,,
,T,plus eight is?,F,,,
,S,eight.,F,,,
,T,all right. that was easy.,F,,,
,S,but I don't know what to use. like threes?,F,,,
,T,you would use threes. try three and six. okay?,F,,,
,S,my stomach's hurting. can I get a drink of water?,F,,,
,T,"sir, no. you have to stay here. all right?",F,,,
,T,"so all right, let's try three. Nick, Jessie, you ready?",T,,,
,S,"two, ten.",F,,,
,T,"if I put in a three there, okay...",F,,,
,S,"it's going to be five, right?",F,,,
,T,you're going to get negative five because the negative plus eight. what's negative five plus eight?,F,,,
,S,three. negative... oh yeah.,F,,,
,T,positive three.,F,,,
,S,"wait... is negative two. wait, is that how you do three?",F,,,
,T,well you wrote it upside down. that's okay. and then the next one is going to be what?,F,,,
,S,negative two.,F,,,
,T,it's going to be negative two. you got it.,F,,,
,S,oh.,F,,,
,T,...two.,F,,,
,S,"oh no, I...",F,,,
,T,"okay, you did that in your head, huh?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,impressive.,F,,,
,S,I always do my work in my head.,F,,,
,T,"okay. so don't let the negatives scare you. just the same idea as the front. just know that when you times, you've got to have a negative, right, in your problem. that's all.",F,,,
,S,all right.,F,,,
,T,"why do you keep getting out of your seat, Robert?",T,,,(teacher goes to new group)
,S,"well, I have to xxx.",F,,,
,T,"I'm coming to... okay, I just kind of noticed out of the corner of my eye. so what's going on here, how we doing?",F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,S,we're doing fine.,F,,,
,T,okay? so have I come by to check all ten equations yet?,F,,,
,S,"no not yet, we're just... we're on number ten.",F,,,(other student says to same student:  <not all ten> [>]. <just the first five> [>]. we're on number ten.)
,T,okay. you are on number ten. you want me to wait until you get number ten done?,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,okay. ,F,,,
,T,all right.,T,,,(teacher goes to new group)
,S,"why did I get it wrong... oh, I didn't write it.",F,,,
,T,"ladies, you've been awful quiet over here. what's going on?",F,,,
,S,"well, because we've been waiting for you?",F,,,
,T,"okay, all right.",F,,,
,S,for like a century.,F,,,
,T,"so where are you stuck? or if you're not stuck, what would like me... do you want me to just check your answers then?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,is that what you're saying?,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,okay. so... so I've already checked the first five? yes or no?,F,,,
,S,no.,F,,,
,T,"oh, really?",F,,,
,S,"well, because you've been over there, you know +...",F,,,
,T,"yeah, I know. I've been pretty busy.",F,,,
,T,"all right, let's start with six through ten.",T,,,
,S,"well, we're only on eight.",F,,,
,T,"so, okay, so I'll do the first eight, how's that?",F,,,
,S,first eight. okay.,F,,,
,T,"all right. so I agree, that's plus twelve. wait a minute, which one are we doing?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"number six. that's plus eight, right?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"two, four, six, eight. good.",F,,,
,T,"now negative five thirds would mean you come down five and you go over three, right?",T,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,so that one's perfect. number seven. you would have started at negative one and because of the negative four slope you would have gone down four and over one.,F,,,
,S,number three.,F,,,
,T,so that one is perfect.,F,,,
,S,and number eight?,F,,,
,T,"okay. and number eight, I'm a little concerned. see how it's slanting up? see, eight's a negative one third.",F,,,
,S,"yeah, but that's a plus twelve.",F,,,
,T,so are you ready? well what does plus twelve mean?,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,up here. ,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,so erase number eight. try number eight again. okay?,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,T,"all right, wait a minute Jessica... all right, let me slow down, then. because trust me, I'm sick and I'm also tired but we can do this, all right. you ready?",T,,,(student shows that she doesn't understand; teacher sits down to go over it)
,S,"zero, three, and six is right, though, right?",F,,,
,T,"zero was twelve. so why did you plot down here, when zero positive twelve is up there.",F,,,
,S,"oh, I made a mistake.",F,,,
,T,"okay, let's look at the rest of your table.",F,,,
,S,I put a negative.,F,,,
,T,"so three. all right, if I put a three here, DeCarlos, what's one third of three?",F,,,
,S,"um, one.",F,,,
,T,"one, right?",F,,,
,T,"so that negative makes it a negative one plus twelve, which was a positive... so you had these points exactly right.",F,,,
,S,I check... I put them backwards.,F,,,
,T,"so you put them down... you plotted wrong, basically, right?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,all right.,T,,,(teacher moves to new group)
,S,Mister Ormsby?,F,,,
,T,"okay, all right. yes? you're finally done, right?",F,,,
,S,yes.,F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,T,if you don't mind I'll just take a quick glance. spot check a few of them because I'd like you to move on to the questions.,T,,,"(teacher checking students' work, doesn't find errors, so few student responses)"
,S,ok. alright.,F,,,
,T,start answering the questions. okay?,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"and the ones I'm looking at right now, like for example, this one here this is number seven. that looks good. ",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"number six, five over three, that looks perfect. okay. ",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"oh, let me see. you just finished ten, right?",F,,,
,S,mm hm.,F,,,
,T,and that one's also perfect. so I can safely say that you guys seem to know what you're doing.,F,,,
