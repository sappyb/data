,S,here.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,going once.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,"oh, I do.",FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,yeah. That's it.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,"oh, wait, I need to write my name on it.",TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,cool.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,is my name on it?,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,it's fine.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,I put your name on it.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,oh.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,"guys, get out your binder reminders.",TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,oh.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,I didn't do it.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,write down tonight's homework assignment.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,

,T,yeah. that's the plan.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,get what?,TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,my binder reminder.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,why? what did you leave it up there for?,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,because I just left it up there.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,

,S,no.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,is that it?,TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,no. because like if we do something then you're gonna see it then we're gonna get caught and get in trouble anyway.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,I see.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,I was just asking.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,"cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down.",TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,I need a towel.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,

,T,"take two, and pass the rest back.",FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,okay.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,"audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody.",TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,"okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.",FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,on tape.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,read it out loud.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,thank you.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,that'll be the most funniest moment.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,

,T,that would be fine.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,"mr. melville, is this a sunspot; the big one right there?",TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,i don't think so.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,are you serious?,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,are you talking about this thing right there?,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,yeah.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,"I think that's just, uh, stuff on your mirror or your lens.",FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,so you guys haven't done yours yet?,TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,we just started.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,"okay. well, you're really close.",FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,see these white spots here?,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,yeah.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,

,T,okay.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,"audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms?",TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,I'm not.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,you're standing there with the door wide open. what are you doing?,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,because beatrice was talking to me and brenda.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,stay away.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,did you find one? you didn't get one moving west.,TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,"yes, I did.",FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,"no, you didn't.",FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,what's west?,TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,the direction that the sunspots move.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,it was this one.,TRUE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,then how come there's not a series of marks?,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,S,because I didn't leave it there.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
,T,okay.,FALSE,TIMSS_science_2,
