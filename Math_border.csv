,T,There are different ways to express the growth of a path of an object. ,T,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"We can see it visually and we've looked at it visually a few times. We can also write about it in words. We can also use algebra to write about it, and we can use numbers. ",F,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"And today we're going to be thinking about the words and this is the question for you guys. Can you, in your group, come up with an instruction, maybe we'll do this on poster so you can write it out, come up with an instruction, for somebody else that if they, if they had any sized, any sized border of any sized figure like this, you'd be able to tell them how many squares were in the red border. ",F,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"So let's think together, what if it was a 3x3 shape? How would you tell them how many squares were in the red border?",T,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"So you can probably think, yesterday we had different ways of doing that. ",F,,,
,S,,,,,
,T,"Yeah, Josh, what do you think? Let's say we had a 3x3.",F,,,
,S,"Thinking of Josh's method,",F,,,
,T,Okay,F,,,
,S,"Three times three, minus four.",F,,,
,T,"Um, which was Josh's...oh, I see. In Josh's method, we thought of each of them as three, then you took away these corners. ",F,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"So, what was another way for working out how many were in a three by three?",T,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,Another method that somebody did yesterday? Isabella?,F,,,
,S,Counting two of the sides with three and the other two with two?,F,,,
,T,"Fantastic, thank you.",F,,,
,T,"So another way of doing it was this. So that was another way of doing it, and then we have the method of thinking of them all as three but then taking away the four corners. ",T,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"So...yeah, Josh.",T,,,
,S,"Also, there's the ""Jo's method"" where instead of using nines you use twos. ",F,,,
,T,Uh-huh. This method.,F,,,
,S,Yeah. ,F,,,
,T,So instead of using threes we use twos?,F,,,
,S,Yeah. ,F,,,
,T,"Is there something, is that it? It's not just all twos. We did nine...",T,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,Are these all the same?,T,,,
,S,"No, they're all different",F,,,
,T,Do they all give us the same answer?,F,,,
,S,"Some give us eight, some give us ten. ",F,,,
,S,"That's eight, that's ten, and that's five.",F,,,
,T,What does this give us?,T,,,
,S,Ten.,F,,,
,T,Ten. And what does this give us?,F,,,
,S,Five?,F,,,
,T,Three times three is...,F,,,
,S,Nine.,F,,,
,T,Minus four is...,F,,,
,S,Five.,F,,,
,T,So what's going wrong? ,F,,,
,S,It's supposed to be three times four minus four. Cause 4 sides.,F,,,
,S2,"No it's three plus, I think it's three plus not times.",F,,,
,T,I think you're right.,F,,,
,T,"So the method we used was this, wasn't it? Three plus three plus three plus three",T,,,
,S,Minus four.,F,,,
,T,Minus four.,F,,,
,T,And we get...eight. So what's going wrong here? Maya?,T,,,
,S,The sides should only be one.,F,,,
,T,"Oh. You're right! This was the method, wasn't it.",F,,,
,S,"It was like, the amount on the top and the bottom and on the sides it's the same times two.",F,,,
,T,"And these, we have to subtract the one we use on each end, don't we?",T,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"Perfect, okay.",F,,,
,T,"So, how about if we were to describe to somebody else, this is what you have to do, describe to somebody else in words how many tiles there would be on any sized border. Can you give them instruction? So say they had a square and we don't know how big the square is but we want to explain to somebody how they would find out how many tiles are in the border. ",T,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,See if you can write in words some instructions for them on how we'd do that. ,F,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,Does that make sense? Do you understand?,F,,,
,S,,F,,,
,T,"We'll come around and help as well. Because this is a hard thing, but we're going to get this together, and if you try in your groups first, then we're going to do it altogether as a class. So have a go at thinking about that and we'll come around and help.",T,,,
