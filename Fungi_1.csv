19:14:51,23:59:31,student,It's too cold. Yeah it was cold outside.,FALSE,-,,
19:15:35,0:00:16,teacher,"um, so let me show you the fungi unit, and so I have one warm-up question for you and its “where have you seen fungi?” jot down a couple of ideas. Ok, so where’s places where you might have seen fungi?",TRUE,Engage,,
19:15:52,0:00:33,student,In my backyard,FALSE,-,,
19:15:52,0:00:33,teacher,"Great, in your backyard where though?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:16:00,0:00:41,student,"Um, towards the mossy area, it’s hard to explain.",FALSE,-,,
19:16:08,0:00:49,teacher,"Towards like the corner, or is it on…",FALSE,Explore,,
19:16:14,0:00:55,student,A bunch of mushrooms,FALSE,-,,

,,student,"Something weird on its ..., its like a disease, that’s what the doctors say.",FALSE,-,,
19:16:29,0:01:10,teacher,"Oh, what’d it look like?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:16:27,0:01:08,student,It was weird looking ...,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Oh ok, so you didn’t get to see what it looked like but you know it was growing on its foot?",FALSE,Explain,,
,,student,Like mushrooms on the trees in the woods.,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Ok, so in the natural environment?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:16:32,0:01:13,student,Those weird things that stick out of the sides of trees.,FALSE,-,,
19:16:46,0:01:27,teacher,"Ok, so on trees.",FALSE,Explain,,
,,student,"Um, on decrepit logs",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,What do you mean (?),FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,"Like just rotted, like, like falling apart ... the fungi ...",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Ok, any other places? Yeah, Diana?",TRUE,Explore,,
,,student,In the grass in my front yard.,FALSE,-,,

19:17:05,0:01:46,student,"No, no. In the grass in my front yard.",FALSE,-,,
19:17:14,0:01:55,teacher,"Oh, the grass, ok great.",FALSE,Explain,,
19:17:22,0:02:03,teacher,"So we’ve seen fungi, um, sometime in our life, uh, whether it’s on food or in nature like on trees or whatnot, we’re gonna be looking at more examples today too, so we have activity 42 for you. So I want you to show me that’s one of the things as you’re going around, um, oh actually as it- as you’re working at your lab station. And at your lab station what you’ll find are some colored pictures of different types of fungi, so there are twelve different types that you can look through. Um, a good idea is to have all the pictures spread out at your lab station so you can look at all of them together. And there are different bins with different types of things in them. So for instance, this station here has um, some fruit, that has uh, fungi growing on them. So you’ll make some observations uh about some of the things you see here. Remember we’re practicing our observations like we did at the beginning of the day. So uh, what kinds of things can you observe when you’re looking at these?",TRUE,Engage,,
19:17:29,0:02:10,student,"Uh, that they’re really old and not healthy.",FALSE,-,,
19:17:37,0:02:18,teacher,"Yeah, so you’re making observations like that, some visual observations that maybe make- it also you can maybe make some guesses about what you think is happening inside some of these things too. So this station here has, um, fruit with mold on it. Um, I’ve got another station with mushrooms on it. Um, another one with petri dishes with mushrooms on them. And I think, um, some fungi growing as well. So, you can take a look- oh and bread, bread growing, uh, mold growing on bread. So when you’re uh, when you’re looking at the different bins here you’re looking at some of the different type of fungi um, and when you’re done, um, I’m going to give every group maybe about six or seven minutes. I’d like the team managers up at the front to kinda keep an eye on the clock, so at about every six or seven minutes I’d like you to take your bin and pass it to the next station, we’ll go in this order.",FALSE,Engage,,
19:17:41,0:02:22,student,"oh, oh, I can smell the pepper",FALSE,-,,
19:20:16,0:04:57,teacher,Which part are you working on?,TRUE,Explore,,
19:20:40,0:05:21,student,We’re working on ...,FALSE,-,,
19:20:47,0:05:28,teacher,"Ok, so you have a good list here, where are you getting this list from?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:20:49,0:05:30,student,From the ...,FALSE,-,,
19:20:53,0:05:34,teacher,"Ah, so your journal is a helpful tool, huh? Ok, so can you maybe describe what you guys know, some examples (?), like they, they made food, what do you mean by that, oh they make food, so you’re saying that-",TRUE,"Explain, Explore",,
19:21:16,0:05:57,student,"No we need food, we need, in our ...",FALSE,-,,
19:21:10,0:05:51,teacher,"Oh they need food, so they don’t make their your own. How do you know? Do you know that for sure?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:21:13,0:05:54,student,"No, it’s something they do. Photosynthesis.",FALSE,-,,
19:21:24,0:06:05,teacher,What are some examples? How do you know they make their own food? What are you basing it off of?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:21:34,0:06:15,student,"Because, well they, normally they always have something- they’re always arguing, they always pretend they’re not growing out of the ground ...",FALSE,-,,
19:21:30,0:06:11,teacher,"Ok, so they- yeah, what’d you say?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:21:44,0:06:25,student,It needs a host so it becomes a host.,FALSE,-,,
19:21:53,0:06:34,teacher,"Um, so, how is it getting the nutrients from it? We know that plants make their own food. We eat food, we eat it with our mouth, how are they eating their food?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:21:56,0:06:37,student,"I don’t know, they eat bacteria. It decomposes.",FALSE,-,,
19:22:28,0:07:09,teacher,What do you mean by that?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:22:32,0:07:13,student,"Like, like, like it disappears after a while and the bacteria’s just left.",FALSE,-,,
19:23:04,0:07:45,teacher,"Oh, ok, so that’s like when you have this piece of bread, like we have this bread here with a lot of mold on it, um-",FALSE,Explain,,
19:22:55,0:07:36,student,"...it will be just fungi, there won’t be any bread.",FALSE,-,,
19:23:22,0:08:03,teacher,"What about some of the other ones, how do they adapt?",TRUE,Engage,,
19:23:29,0:08:10,student,"You see it spread, it like spreads around the bread. They’re all different hosts and they have to adapt to the different host.",FALSE,-,,
19:23:46,0:08:27,teacher,"Ok, can you give me an example that you might have seen, or?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:23:55,0:08:36,student,"well, the difference between some of the mushrooms, is like, I think that’s the fungi on this one, and that’s way different between- from say this example, and I’m assuming this is maybe in a wetter climate.",FALSE,-,,
19:23:59,0:08:40,teacher,So these adaptations are for what reason?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:24:03,0:08:44,student,"Uh, to live, like, to survive.",FALSE,-,,
19:24:07,0:08:48,teacher,To gain some of the nutrients it might need?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:24:16,0:08:57,student,Yeah.,FALSE,-,,
19:24:20,0:09:01,teacher,"Um, what about, how do they reproduce?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:24:28,0:09:09,student,I think it’s binary fission.,FALSE,-,,
19:24:32,0:09:13,teacher,"Just like what we talked about with uh ..., so that might be something that might be something that’s listed where how are fungi different from plants, you know, like, they reproduce kind of like plants reproduce. Plants reproduce by binary fission",TRUE,Explain,,
19:24:45,0:09:26,student,"No, No. They did the, Pollen. The pollen spreading. Pollination.",FALSE,-,,
19:24:50,0:09:31,teacher,"So are we moving on to the next part where it’s basic things they need to survive, just so you guys are already thinking about that list and that might be a good idea, you can use that to-",TRUE,Explain,,
19:24:55,0:09:36,student,"We need to make sure how they reproduce. The yeast is alive, like yogurt.",FALSE,-,,
19:26:47,0:11:28,teacher,"Yogurt, what do you mean?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:26:53,0:11:34,student,"Like, because it’s alive, but not alive alive.",FALSE,-,,
19:26:57,0:11:38,teacher,"Oh, ok. So what were you guys talking about before that?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:27:10,0:11:51,student,"Um, he he kept saying that mushrooms are living organisms and like they don’t feed on dead organisms, or something like that. That would make fungus a cannibal.",FALSE,-,,
19:27:14,0:11:55,teacher,It would make them a cannibal?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:27:30,0:12:11,student,"Well, I thought mushrooms and fungus are not dead organisms usually.",FALSE,-,,
19:27:34,0:12:15,teacher,"Yeah, I mean like, what are some examples that you’ve seen them growing on?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:27:34,0:12:15,student,Decaying wood,FALSE,-,,
19:27:34,0:12:15,teacher,On decaying wood. Anywhere else?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:27:37,0:12:18,student,"Uh, on old food. Like, wet, wet, old clammy places. Like, one time I took a bunch of sand and, uh, dirt and water and everything and then put it in an airtight container, and in like two days mold started to grow.",FALSE,-,,
19:27:51,0:12:32,teacher,"Yeah, how did it get there?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:27:54,0:12:35,student,"I think it’s like because of the climate, and I think it’s like, I think it’s, being like carried, like carried along, and then it like, kinda like emerges, like grows",FALSE,-,,
19:27:56,0:12:37,teacher,"Would you say like, well, but how come it wasn’t growing when you first obtained it?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:27:59,0:12:40,student,"Because it’s not, uh, it’s maybe because they didn’t like that habitat so they stay hidden.",FALSE,-,,
19:28:07,0:12:48,teacher,"So what are some things that maybe all, all fungi need in order to like emerge?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:28:10,0:12:51,student,Like wetness,FALSE,-,,
19:28:23,0:13:04,teacher,"Wet stuff, ok",FALSE,Evaluate,,
19:28:27,0:13:08,student,"And it’s usually dark, they’re usually in dark places.",FALSE,-,,
19:28:31,0:13:12,teacher,"Where did you keep them, when you-?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:28:42,0:13:23,student,"Uh, I kept them on my windowsill, but there’s like a bunch of trees blocking the windowsill so not a lot of light comes through",FALSE,-,,
19:28:57,0:13:38,teacher,Ok,FALSE,Evaluate,,
19:29:00,0:13:41,student,"Some like dark areas and cold areas similar to ...Like, because, in the forest there’s usually not much light and uh, I went with my family where, for edible mushrooms and they like all grow in the dark shadows.",FALSE,-,,
19:29:11,0:13:52,teacher,"Why would they grow in those kinds of areas, you think?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:29:22,0:14:03,student,It’s their natural habitat?,FALSE,-,,
19:29:54,0:14:35,teacher,"when you think about plants, plants grow in certain areas, um, to survive, and get sunlight and whatnot. Um, why would fungi grow in like the dark woods are they getting anything from it?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:30:16,0:14:57,student,Wetness. Water. Food that they need to survive.,FALSE,-,,
19:30:21,0:15:02,teacher,"Um, sure. When you- You guys talked about a lot of good stuff. As you’re, um, going back through this maybe you can add some of those ideas you just talked about.",FALSE,Engage,,
19:30:33,0:15:14,student,Ew,FALSE,-,,
19:30:40,0:15:21,teacher,Pull them out,FALSE,-,,
19:30:47,0:15:28,student,They’re still wet,FALSE,-,,
19:31:00,0:15:41,teacher,You can even kinda touch them,FALSE,Engage,,
19:31:07,0:15:48,student,"It’s soggy. Yeah see- like wetness. I like it, put water",FALSE,-,,
19:31:37,0:16:18,teacher,"How is this, uh, how is this like the, the fruit that you just saw?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:31:42,0:16:23,student,"Well it’s like it looks really old and it’s like, it’s wet. So I think it does have to have a wet climate because this is wet and like the fruit was wet, and I added water to that, my little, uh, stuff that I made, so that’s probably why-",FALSE,-,,
19:31:46,0:16:27,teacher,"So you’re saying that if I used like dry bread it wouldn’t at all, you wouldn’t see any mold?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:32:35,0:17:16,student,"No, it’s not that- just not as much, not as fast. Because it would gain water eventually from air.",FALSE,-,,
19:32:58,0:17:39,teacher,"Um, so it takes time for mold to grow. Um, why? Why does it take so much time?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:33:02,0:17:43,student,"Because it still has, it probably still has to, uh, um, break out the egg or reproduce or something like that.",FALSE,-,,
19:33:04,0:17:45,teacher,"Reproduce. Ok. In what way though, like, what do you mean? So when you’re looking at this here you’re saying that as it gets bigger and bigger and bigger you’re saying that it’s reproducing or that it’s growing?",FALSE,"Evaluate, explore",,
19:33:16,0:17:57,student,It could be growing or reproducing.,FALSE,-,,
19:33:16,0:17:57,teacher,What do you guys think?,FALSE,Engage,,
19:33:18,0:17:59,student,I think it’s growing,FALSE,-,,
19:33:25,0:18:06,teacher,"You think it’s growing. You’re saying reproducing, so when you’re looking at all these different types of fungi too, are they all, like, reproducing in the same way you think?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:33:43,0:18:24,student,"Kind of, because like some of the mushrooms are connected, in a way.",FALSE,-,,
19:33:52,0:18:33,teacher,"Oh, they’re all connected? Do you see that in any of the other kind of fungi here? What about this one here? Are they all like, maybe connected at some point? Or is that like one, like, one mushroom here and just ...?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:33:55,0:18:36,student,"Like trees that can, like, grow more of them because they’re on the same tree.",FALSE,-,,
19:34:01,0:18:42,teacher,"Well, look at, look through some more of these pictures here, any other similarities, like how there’s tons of mushroom here, are there some patterns that you see as well?",TRUE,Expore,,
19:34:04,0:18:45,student,Like here the bread is kind of dry and there’s not that much mold visible.,FALSE,-,,
19:34:07,0:18:48,teacher,"Oh, that’s a good, that’s a good observation.",FALSE,Evaluate,,
19:34:12,0:18:53,teacher,"Um, let’s hear some ideas that you have right now. What are some things that you notice that maybe are similar or different? Joe?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:34:21,0:19:02,student,"Um, they have, well they have, some fungus are attached to trees and we don’t.",FALSE,-,,
19:34:32,0:19:13,teacher,"Ok, great. They grow on different things. So I heard- what did you say?",FALSE,"Evaluate, explore",,
19:34:51,0:19:32,student,"I said that, uh, fungus attaches to different things like trees and we don’t.",FALSE,-,,
19:35:04,0:19:45,teacher,Does anyone want to add to that idea or shoot off with a new idea?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:35:04,0:19:45,student,"Uh, well, they need a host to grow on.",FALSE,-,,
19:35:14,0:19:55,teacher,"Ok, I’ll add that on here.",FALSE,-,,
19:35:26,0:20:07,student,And they need a brain.,FALSE,-,,
19:35:28,0:20:09,teacher,"So let's go back to that idea. Why do they need a host, what's a host?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:35:40,0:20:21,student,"Uh, sort of like, uh...",FALSE,-,,
19:35:42,0:20:23,teacher,You can give me an example.,FALSE,Explore,,
19:35:59,0:20:40,student,"Like we eat candy bars and cereal, but that could be its nutrience and its food it eats, just like how plants, how they need water, sun, and air to create the sugar that they make.",FALSE,-,,
19:36:10,0:20:51,teacher,So fungi grow on things for their food.,FALSE,Explain,,
,,student,They might grow on other things for protection.,FALSE,-,,
19:36:18,0:20:59,teacher,"Oh, for protection, too. Could you maybe give us an example?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:36:30,0:21:11,student,"Like, some animals might like to eat that fungus and maybe it would be harder to find it on the tree or whatever it's on.",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,You think the thing might have some kind of predator or something that might want to eat it?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:36:36,0:21:17,student,"Yeah, maybe.",FALSE,-,,
19:36:37,0:21:18,teacher,"Any other ideas, off of that one?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:36:52,0:21:33,student,"Um, we move and talk and they just kind of stay in one place and don't have a language that we know of.",FALSE,-,,
19:36:52,0:21:33,teacher,"I like what you said, they have a language we don't know of, so maybe they have a language.",FALSE,"Evaluate, explain",,
19:36:50,0:21:31,teacher,"Alright so, they don't move. Anything else? Rebecca.",TRUE,Explore,,
19:37:12,0:21:53,student,They use runners to grow.,FALSE,-,,
19:37:16,0:21:57,teacher,Can you say that a little louder?,FALSE,-,,
19:37:25,0:22:06,student,Runners.,FALSE,-,,
19:37:27,0:22:08,teacher,Water?,FALSE,-,,
19:37:37,0:22:18,student,Runners.,FALSE,-,,
19:37:45,0:22:26,teacher,What are those?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:37:58,0:22:39,student,"What they do is recreate a part of themselves, they grow on other trees and use things called ""runners.""",FALSE,-,,
19:38:03,0:22:44,teacher,"What are runners, what do they look like? Have you seen them before?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:38:16,0:22:57,teacher,"So you're saying they have...let's talk about the mold, so you're saying theres' runners?",FALSE,Explain,,
19:38:22,0:23:03,student,They can replant themselves.,FALSE,-,,
19:38:32,0:23:13,teacher,So it would just be a part of themselves that keeps growing and branching outward?,FALSE,Explain,,
19:38:36,0:23:17,student,Yeah.,FALSE,-,,
19:38:49,0:23:30,teacher,Sounds good.,FALSE,Evaluate,,
19:38:58,0:23:39,teacher,Let's go ahead and continue where we left off yesterday. We were talking about how fungi are like and unlike plants.,TRUE,Engage,,
19:39:05,0:23:46,student,"You said they don't need photosynthesis, I'm thinking they just have the water to stay hydrated but they get their nutrience from like, maybe the dirty stuff that's around them, cause almost everything has nutrience.",FALSE,-,,
19:39:20,0:24:01,teacher,So they get stuff from everything that's around them? Anyone want to add to that? Alex?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:39:45,0:24:26,student,Maybe they get food from the host they're growing on?,FALSE,-,,
19:39:58,0:24:39,teacher,"For food, so, and then, Ollie was saying some of the rotten stuff around them. Anika?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:40:10,0:24:51,student,"I agree with Alex, with the bread, we saw that the bread got thinner, so we're thinking that the bacteria, or the fungi took out of the bread. And also with fruits and vegetables it like shrivels the food up.",FALSE,-,,
19:40:11,0:24:52,teacher,"So you're saying they kind of break things, break that down like in a stomach? Yeah, Patrick?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:40:19,0:25:00,student,"Maybe it has to stay wet to live, so that's why it doesn't live in lighted places, so like it doesn't dry up or something.",FALSE,-,,
19:40:26,0:25:07,teacher,So it's one of the conditions. Okay.,FALSE,Explain,,
19:40:34,0:25:15,teacher,"Yeah, James?",TRUE,-,,
19:40:47,0:25:28,student,"Well they probably eat the host, because if the size decreases, it might be the fungus eating it.",FALSE,-,,
19:40:56,0:25:37,teacher,"It must be eating it. So if you're looking at the picture of the orange with fungus all over it, is it growing on it because of moisture? Is it growing on it because it's doing something else? What do you guys think about that?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:41:01,0:25:42,teacher,"Yeah, Kevin?",TRUE,-,,
19:41:22,0:26:03,student,"Well, first of all, maybe the orange is in a dark place, and that in turn helps the orange to grow.",FALSE,-,,
19:41:21,0:26:02,teacher,"Okay, so it just needs the moisture that's on there, it'll live on anything that's moist, maybe?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:41:21,0:26:02,student,"I'm thinking that the bacteria and fungus is always there, it's just microscopic so you can't see it, and if the food isn't eaten before it starts rotting, that's when the bacteria and the mold start feeding off of it and that's when it grows so we can see it.",FALSE,-,,
19:41:26,0:26:07,teacher,"Okay, so food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it. How many of you agree with that, food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it, or, food is rotten because mold grows on it. How many of you agree with the first statement? Raise your hands. How many of you agree with the second statement? So what's going on there?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:41:59,0:26:40,student,"Maybe when maggots eat it, maybe like, when the maggots, their waste creates a mold, or a fungi? When there's mold there's fungi?",FALSE,-,,
19:42:03,0:26:44,teacher,So you're saying that the fungi are similar to the maggots that eat the...?,FALSE,Explain,,
19:42:23,0:27:04,student,"Or maybe the waste creates the fungi, as it eats it.",FALSE,-,,
19:42:50,0:27:31,teacher,So the maggots eat the dead thing and it will create a fungus?,FALSE,Explain,,
19:42:55,0:27:36,student,"I don't know, yeah.",FALSE,-,,
19:43:04,0:27:45,teacher,Maybe someone help me out. Ben?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:43:20,0:28:01,student,"I don't think that they really eat the food, I think they suck out all the water, cause water mostly makes up a fruit's mass, so if it shrivels and loses most of its mass, that must mean that the water's getting out. And also, whenever I see fungi, it seems like it has a bunch of moisture around it, I'm wondering if it's because its water inside it is evaporated.",FALSE,-,,
19:43:26,0:28:07,teacher,"Okay, you mean like if it's in a bag, and it has moisture in it? So we see it growing on places with water. And it needs moisture to grow.",FALSE,Explain,,
19:43:44,0:28:25,teacher,"Let's talk about this idea more. If they're growing on places you thought, do you think they're getting anything out of that at all? Like rotten food. Would you eat rotten food? Do you think most living things would want to eat rotten food?",TRUE,Explore,,
19:44:21,0:29:02,student,No.,FALSE,-,,
19:44:27,0:29:08,teacher,"So what is rotten food? What does that mean when we say it's ""rotten""?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:44:31,0:29:12,student,"It's kinda like expired, and like it's not good for you to eat because it makes you sick.",FALSE,-,,
19:44:39,0:29:20,teacher,"Okay, but why is it not good for you to eat, though?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:44:51,0:29:32,student,"But not all rotten is bad for you to eat, 'cause all cheese is rotten, because they make cheese with rotten milk, so not all rotten things are bad.",FALSE,-,,
19:45:07,0:29:48,student,"Maybe it's decomposing, so maybe the nutrience in it, like the freshness and the combining nutrience are like turning bad?",FALSE,-,,
19:45:14,0:29:55,teacher,They're taking the stuff and turning it into...say that one more time.,FALSE,Explain,,
,,student,"The nutrience that used to be good for you, now are like, since it's rotten basically, the goodness is gone, so it's just nothing, it makes you sick.",FALSE,-,,
19:45:30,0:30:11,teacher,"So you're saying...the ""goodness"", what is goodness?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
19:45:41,0:30:22,student,It's the stuff like the nutrience that's good for you.,FALSE,-,,
19:45:53,0:30:34,teacher,Like what?,FALSE,explore,,
19:46:05,0:30:46,student,Like the vitamins and everything?,FALSE,-,,
19:46:16,0:30:57,teacher,"Like vitamins and what not. Okay so you're saying that fungi start off on fresh stuff, and then they break stuff down and take all the goodness away, is that what you're saying?",FALSE,explain,,
19:46:16,0:30:57,teacher,I'm trying to see if I'm getting the right idea down.,FALSE,-,,
19:46:30,0:31:11,student,Yeah.,FALSE,-,,
19:46:38,0:31:19,teacher,Anyone want to add to that? Maybe I'm thinking differently to what Ollie is saying.,FALSE,Explore,,
19:46:44,0:31:25,student,"I don't think they start out on fresh stuff, because I think when it starts to go bad, they form on it because I think they're attracted to food that goes bad. Cause, I dont' know, you dont' just buy a really fresh loaf of bread and then the next day fungus grows on it. It's like maybe after 2 weeks you see fungus growing on it.",FALSE,-,,
19:46:56,0:31:37,teacher,Where did it come from then? How did fungus get on things you seal completely? Any ideas?,FALSE,Explore,,
19:47:09,0:31:50,teacher,"Yeah, Ben?",FALSE,-,,
19:47:12,0:31:53,student,They probably travel through air or touch.,FALSE,-,,
19:47:25,0:32:06,teacher,"Like what parts of them, they just like float through the air, so you're saying we've got fungus all around us right now, you think?",FALSE,"Explore, explain",,
19:47:40,0:32:21,student,"Well, I don't know, maybe people inhale them and breathe them out?",FALSE,-,,
19:48:01,0:32:42,teacher,Travel through air.,FALSE,Explain,,
19:48:19,0:33:00,teacher,"Yeah, Grace.",TRUE,-,,
19:48:26,0:33:07,student,"I think if you... when you touch it, and there's fungus or bacteria on your hands, then after a while it starts to add up.",FALSE,-,,
19:48:37,0:33:18,teacher,"Okay, so once we like touch a type of... let's say you've got fungus on your hand or fungus is in the air, and it gets onto something, if it's so microscopic then how is it we can see it? We've got like the strawberries that had mold all over, the blackberries that are growing mold all around it, isn't it microscopic, though? how's it getting, why can we see it?",FALSE,Explore,,
19:48:41,0:33:22,teacher,"Yeah, Ian, what do you think?",FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,Like binary fission?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Binary, what do you mean by that? Can you tell me what that is?",FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,"Like cells keep constantly dividing, so it's not one cell, it's like a million cells each one from one original?",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Okay, so you're saying bacteria do binary fission, so are you saying they are multiplying?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
,,teacher,"Yeah, Ollie.",TRUE,-,,
,,student,"Since there's like lots and lots of bacteria like billions in this cubic centimeter there can't just be one to reproduce all of that. I bet like, since it's getting all its nutrience from the fruit, since it's being really healthy and all, it starts reproducing all of them, that's why it grows so much that we can see it.",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,So you're saying there's a bunch of different types of fungus that's growing? Or it's just one individual that keeps growing?,FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
,,student,It's lots of types.,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Let's go back to this idea of, they grow on other things as a host, and it breaks things down. How might it break it down? Or how might it be similar to how we break things down? Any similarities you can think of?",TRUE,Explore,,
,,teacher,Patrick?,FALSE,-,,
,,student,"Well like, our stomachs have acids that break things down, so maybe like the acids break things down?",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,They use acids.,FALSE,Explain,,
,,student,"But when Ben said when a fruit breaks things down it decomposes, so more nutrience comes out, so wouldn't it be better to eat rotten fruit than fresh fruit?",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Hmm, good question. Alex do you have an answer?",FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,"I'm pretty sure that when something decomposes, the nutrience are leaving whatever is decomposing is going into the soil or whatever, so that's why we have composts.",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,Like composts in what way?,FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,To help make...hmm.,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"So that's something we can think about, so part of adding nutrience is maybe like composts? Claire?",TRUE,Explore,,
,,student,"I think the nutrience for us is when it's not rotting and the nutrience for other things like gardens and stuff is when it is rotting, cause if you put like banana peels and things like that into a compost bin, it turns into dirt and has tons of nutrience and it's really good for growing things, so um, fungi could also help break down things like that. It does have nutrience for other things.",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Great, so maybe it's like compost and it provides things for other things, like dirt for nutrience?",FALSE,"Evauate, explore",,
,,teacher,"So we have a great start here. We've got so many ideas up here that are really great. Some of them kind of are different from one another or contradict one another, but we're going to start trying to figure out how these kind of connec tto one another, maybe figure out how do fungi decompose, how do they move, do they move at all? Do they grow in moist places? Why do they do some of these things? So we're gonna talk about that more during this unit. What questions do you have that maybe we can try to answer as we go along as well? Yesterday's homework I actually made you think of a couple questions, what questions do you have about fungi? Yeah, Ben?",TRUE,"Evaluate, explore",,
,,student,Can they rot still living things?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,Can they rot food?,FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,"Like, rot still living things?",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Oh, okay. You're using rot like a verb? Can they rot living things.",FALSE,Explore,,
,,teacher,Any other questions? Ollie.,TRUE,-,,
,,student,"If we eat a rotting fruit, is the fungi what makes us sick?",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"Any other questions you have, yeah, Amy?",FALSE,-,,
,,student,How do fungi eat?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,How DO fungi eat?,FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,Why do fungi make that terrible smell?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,Do they all make that smell? Good question.,FALSE,Explore,,
,,student,How do they reproduce?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,How do they reproduce.,FALSE,Explore,,
,,teacher,"Um, Yadi.",TRUE,-,,
,,student,How many parts do they have?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,How many parts do they have.,FALSE,Explore,,
,,teacher,That's real good.,FALSE,Evaluate,,
,,teacher,"Um, Roxton and then Patrick.",TRUE,-,,
,,student,Is mushroom a fungi?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,Patrick?,FALSE,-,,
,,student,How does fungi acquire nutrience?,FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,How does it acquire nutrience.,FALSE,Explore,,
,,teacher,Any others?,TRUE,Explore,,
,,teacher,Kevin?,FALSE,-,,
,,student,"Well, can it survive if it's like extreme heat?",FALSE,-,,
,,teacher,"As we're going along, too, we'll add questions if we have more. This is a great place to start off.",FALSE,Evaluate,,
