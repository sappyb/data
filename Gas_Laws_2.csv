,[You]:,"Let's get started. As I walked around I saw a lot of you had some new ideas about pressure, a lot of you talked about pressure. And a lot of you were talking about air. Some of you said you learned some new things about temperature, and compression, and the molecules. And so, before we continue today, we're going to continue gathering information, trying to figure out how this tanker crushed. But before we do that I would like to look back over your posters from yesterday. So we going to look at the posters and make a list of what is causing the tanker to crush based on your ideas. And also, I want us to start looking, does anything seem to be linked together? so does one thing happening in the tanker seem to cause another thing to happen. So as we look through this, that's what we'll be looking for. So with this group, they showed us here the molecules moving around. So I think this one did a really good job of showing us those molecules moving inside the tanker. And then they said, as it cooled down, what happened to the molecules?",T,Using instructional aids,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Slower.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"They became slower. And she- they showed us that those molecules slowed down. They also showed us some air outside of the tanker. And they show us then, what happens then to the air molecules? In this one right here?",F,Using instructional aids,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,They stopped.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"They, well, maybe they stopped. You're right, they're not showing us that they're moving at all, but we know that molecules don't ever stop moving until they get to absolute zero. But they're moving more slowly, and they're compressed. Okay, so they're really thinking about how temperature is affecting the molecules inside the tanker. Um, let's see, this one and this one. Took that a little bit further and talked about how temperature affected that gas. And, can you see what they're showing here? What happens to the gas when it got cooler? What do we see forming here?",F,Using instructional aids,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It changed to a liquid.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Yeah, so it's actually having a phase change. We're getting liquid water collecting at the bottom of the tanker. Look, they're showing us here, are there any more gas- water particles in this picture? They said it all turned to liquid. So they had this idea that it started all as a gas, and then it started to, um, condense and become liquid, and eventually it all became liquid. And this group started to think about this too. Started to think about this, um, this orange is showing that it was a gas, and then it didn't dry up, but they talked about this being water at the bottom of the tanker. And then, some groups started to think about pressure, and the molecules moving around. So this group shows the molecules moving. Here they're showing arrows. And they're showing these arrows going out, showing that there's collisions going against the edge here, of the tanker. So they're thinking about the pressure that's being created by the molecules moving around here and then they said that as it gets colder they're slowing down, so again they're talking about the speed of the molecules. And they're talking about pressure here too. And they're also trying to think about these air molecules outside the tanker. So they have little drawings of air molecules here, and they're showing arrows of that air pushing against the tanker. They're thinking that that air is just pushing down on the top. So that's something we can think about. And then, this group also talked about pressure. This is the one where they said, they kind of imagined the that this air around the tanker is like a giant foot pushing down on it, on the tank. Can this group remind us why the air foot able to crush this one and not this one?",F,Using instructional aids,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because the first one had gas in it, the gas was creating pressure up against the wall of the tank, and if it was turned into water the tank probably wasn't having as much pressure on the sides of it.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,So it was probably easier for it to crush.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So, something about a difference between what was inside here versus here which allowed that pressure outside to have different affects between this one and this one. And I think that this group also showed us that, they said the pressure inside became less than the pressure outside, so it allowed it to crush. So we have all these ideas that we're working on, and so, we have some idea of temperature. What did temperature, tell someone next to you, what did temperature seem to affect inside the tanker? Tell someone next to you. What did the temperature seem to affect? Ok, so what did it seem to affect?",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,Having Students Provide Explicit Explaination,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The molecules.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"What about the molecules inside? Ok, so temperature affected the molecules. What about the molecules?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,They got slower.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so it affected speed and phase. And we also talked about some pressure here. Pressure inside the can, or the tanker, and pressure outside. So the pressure inside, what does that link to? Tell someone next to you, what does pressure inside, how is that affected or what caused pressure inside of the can to change? Tell somebodynext to you. What caused the pressure inside of the can to change? So something about the pressure inside, which groups showed us the pressure of the molecules inside the can having and affect, or inside the taker having an affect?",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,Having Students Provide Explicit Explaination,,Explain
,[Bot]:,That one.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Which one? This one? Ok, what did they say about what caused this pressure against the walls of the- Vernon? What caused the pressure here?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Uh, the steam.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"So something about the steam and, so, the pressure inside caused by what?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The steam.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Caused by the steam?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It kept the shape.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. Because gasses take the shape of the container. Ok, so I want you to keep thinking about this. What's causing that pressure inside? And how about the pressure outside? What did the pressure outside have to do with this scenario? Who showed something about pressure outside having an affect?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Justin's group. The pink paper.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"This one talked about, you talked about. The pink paper did show air outside, and so did- did this group? Did you guys talk about air out here? And I think there's one more. This air foot was kind of an idea of pressure outside. So what does the pressure outside do to the tanker, based on what some of your groups have talked about?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Compression.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so it crushes the tanker. And I want you to continue thinking about this. Why would it crush the tanker? Why does it have the ability to crush it? Because it's not getting crushed here, and it's not getting crushed here, right? So we're going to continue adding to our list here as we continue today.",F,,,,?
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"And you have tongs to touch the cans, so don't touch the can with your fingers. You're going to put it on the hotplate and turn it on and wait until it starts to boil. You'll see steam coming out and you'll hear it boiling. And let it boil for about a minute. Then, you're going to wear your goggles the whole time. You're going to take your tongs, pick up your can, and you're going to flip it over with the top part into the plastic. Ok? So what do you think is going to happen?",T,Questioning and Prompting ,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"I think it's going to air, the air-",F,,,,
,[You]:,Tell someone next to you.,F,Giving Explicit Instruction,Having Students Provide Explicit Explaination,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It's going to do like the tanker do.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. So what do you think is going to happen?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,It's going to crush.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so I hear some people saying it's going to crush or impload. Why would it do that?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,Having Students Provide Explicit Explaination,,Explore
,[Bot]:,[silence],F,,,,
,[You]:,What? You can't tell? You don't know what will happen?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,I know it's going to crush.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, you know it's going to crush. You've seen it before. We don't know why. We're changing the temperature. We're boiling it and then we're putting it in cold water.",F,,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Oh! I think it might make it, like, make the molecules squishing together.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Tani asked a good question. She said are we going to seal the top of the container. So, when we take this can and we flip it over, what are we doing to the top of the container here?",F,Using instructional aids,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Sealing it.,F,,,,
,[You]:,You're going to be covering it. So you're going to keep thinking about that. And I'm not going to show you what's going to happen. I want you to do it yourself. Ok?,F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explore
,,,,,,,
,[Bot]:,It's going to cause a reaction.,T,,,,
,[You]:,What kind of reaction?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Facilitating Students to Extend Newly-Acquired Knowledge and Skills,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Um, cold and hot together, which means it willâ€¦ impload I guess.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,"It has no air, so...",F,,,,
,[You]:,What has no air?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Facilitating Students to Extend Newly-Acquired Knowledge and Skills,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,This.,F,,,,
,[You]:,What do you mean it has no air?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Facilitating Students to Extend Newly-Acquired Knowledge and Skills,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,It can't get in.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so air can't get in. So how does that affect it, you think?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,Facilitating Students to Extend Newly-Acquired Knowledge and Skills,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Well, just like our theory. They're just trying to get in there.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so, alright, so you have your can, it's flipped over, and, what do you mean by air is trying to get in?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Well, since it's cold, the water- the temperature of the water causes it to be cold, and- I don't know, actually.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so I want you to keep thinking about that. Think about that air, and you're describing it as it wants to get in, but I want you to think about what is that air doing on the outside of the can.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Ok.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So you can start by doing number one, you can start by drawing the pop can, and you can start by drawing that stage one, the pop can, when there's fifteen milliliters of water in it.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explore
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,What happened?,T,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,It sucked it in.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Oh.,F,,,,?
,[Bot]:,The water went schloop.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so let's talk about what just happned here. You have your first can here, and so, you should be showing me what's in the can, and draw the molecules of gas inside the can. So, I see in Tani's picture, she has some water in the bottom. Is there any- what else is in this can?",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Pop. A little bit.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so maybe there's a little bit of pop. And what else is in there?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Air.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Yeah, so there's air in the can, too. And now I see that you have it on the hot plate here, what happens as you're heating it up?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Steam.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Steam's coming out. And what- So, can you show me, um- draw the molecules of gas that's inside the can. Show me what they're doing. Use the arrows to show the movement of the molecules inside. So now, these, to me, look like they're just sitting there. Are they moving?",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,Having Students Provide Explicit Explanation,,Explain
,[Bot]:,No.,F,,,,
,[You]:,They're not moving?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Having Students Provide Explicit Explanation,,Explain
,[Bot]:,What's moving? The little molecules?,F,,,,
,[You]:,How can I tell by looking at this that they're moving?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Having Students Provide Explicit Explanation,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Oh. Haha.,F,,,,
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,Why would water go into the can you think?,T,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Because the pressure went schloop. The pressure sucked it in. The cold air sucked it in. Negative pressure.,F,,,,
,[You]:,What do you mean by that?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"The pressure's not pushing it out, it's sucking it in because it's negative.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So, how could you also explain negative pressure, thinking about comparing two pressures? Because that might help you think about what's happening on theoutside of the can too. So think about comparing pressures.",F,Questioning and Prompting ,Having Students Provide Explicit Explanation,,Explain
,[Bot]:,We should do this one.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"You can. You can do that one as you work on the next ones. I want you to think about, especially, I heard you start to think of some ideas. I want you to think about the can crushing and what do you wonder about how you can change the experiment. Like, what do you think might affect how much the can crushes? Or what do you think might affect the temperature of the gas?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"So you think you can maybe change the temperature of this, and then how much water you can put inside the can? Ok, so, and then you're going to be- I see, you already started here. So you think the water might affect- What are you thinking about the water? The amount of water?",T,,Having Students Provide Explicit Explanation,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So the amount of water might affect the can because?,F,,Having Students Provide Explicit Explanation,,Explain
,[Bot]:,We haven't gotten that far.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. Haha. So what do you think? How could changing the amount of water inside the can affect it?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"It's possible that it would crush it more, or less.",F,,,,
,[You]:,If you did what?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,If you add different amount of water to it.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so let's take one example. We put less water inside of it, what do you think might happen?",F,,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Probably wouldn't crush as much.,F,,,,
,[You]:,As much what?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because there's less pressure inside of it, there's less pressure change.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,There's less steam because there's less water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so maybe if there's less steam, it would crush less. And then what if you put less water in here?",F,,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,I don't think it would crush as much if you put a lot of water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Why?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because it would have- I don't know, I just don't think it would.",F,,,,
,[You]:,I think you have a good idea. Why do you think it might not?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Because there's too much pressure on the inside. Too much water for it to do that. Because I know if you squish something it pushes up.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. So something about the water might be too much-,F,Giving Explicit Clarification,Summarizing Ideas,,Explore
,[Bot]:,It would be too full.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so it takes up too much space. Ok. So those are the kinds of questions, er statements I want you to make here. So you can say, I think the amount of water might affect the can pressure because- and explain why.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"Can you think of anything else we could change about what we did here, that might affect the cans?",T,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Colder water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Colder water? Where?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,In the bucket.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So, I'm not sure if we could make this much colder, but what if we made it, just, without ice? What do you think would happen then?",F,,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,It wouldn't crush as much.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Why not?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because it's not really cold. This has to be really hot, this has to be really cold, when they touch each other they try to communicate with each other, but they can't, so it's like a negative.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So let's think about- I heard two things here. I heard one, about the temperature of the can, how hot to make that, and I also heard about the temperature of that. So you could do two things. You think that the- I think that the temperature of the water, the ice, the water bath could affect how much the can crushed because- and then tell me why you think that. And then also, you said something about the temperature inside the can. So maybe, I think that the temperature inside the can, or maybe how long it boils, would affect it because- So that's what you're going to write.",F,,Summarizing Ideas,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"So, what would happen right there, would it affect, like, a plastic bottle?",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh, so also, ok, so maybe-",F,,,,?
,[Bot]:,"Like, does it have to be metal or aluminum?",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Great question. So go ahead and write that question here. Or here. So here's your questions, here your going to actually try to think about why your questions, like, how it might affect it. So you might say, does the kind of material affect it? And here you would say, I think the material does affect it because- and explain why.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Ok.,F,,,,
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so tell me more about that, the how much space the water takes up part.",T,Questioning and Prompting ,Facilitating Students to Extend Newly-Acquired Knowledge and Skills,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Um, I know if we put like, a lot of water, it's not going to crush as much. Because we measured that can to that can, and we put 15 in this one, and put 40 in that one.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh, you put more in that one. Ok. So you already did a little experiment.",F,,,,?
,[Bot]:,which one was- This one was more than that one.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So, you've already had- you've already done it and you see a difference. So what are your ideas about why that one didn't crush as much?",F,,Facilitating Students to Extend Newly-Acquired Knowledge and Skills,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Because we put more water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so you know- You kinda see that the amount of water affected it.",F,,,,?
,[Bot]:,Uh huh.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"And could you say that there's maybe two things going on, what and what?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Pressure and space.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Pressure difference and space. So, there's more water in here, what does that do to the space?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,There's less space for it to implode.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh, so the water is already taking up space for the implosion. And you also think that that water has something to do with the difference in pressure.",F,,Summarizing Ideas,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So think about, in your reading last night, you read something about the behavior of gasses and, um, there compression. So you want to continue thinking about that, like, compression of gas versus how much you compressed water. Think about how that might affect your results.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. And so it says make sure to draw the molecules of gas inside the can, use arrows to show the movement of the molecules. So this is the beginning one, and this one's on the hot plate?",T,Questioning and Prompting ,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So where- Is there any gas in this can right now?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Um, not really. No. The liquid's just- It's just liquid right now. It's at the bottom. It's not being heated.",F,,,,
,[You]:,So what's in this space of the can?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Some air.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Air? What is air?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,[silence],F,,,,
,[You]:,"Is air a solid, a liquid, or a gas?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Uh, a gas.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So we have water and we have, like, oxygen, or our air molecules that should be in this part your can. So how could you draw those in there?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Um, like circles, or?",F,,,,
,[You]:,Yeah. Little- just like circles or particles.,F,Giving Explicit Clarification,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,The particles can be air?,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Mhmm. But I want you to continue thinking of what's happening now when it's being heated up. What's happening inside the can, ok?",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"Hey, so I heard you guys are debating about whether or not this was sealed or not sealed. So tell me more about that.",T,Orchastrating Group Discussion,Having Students Provide Explicit Explanation,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Oh, we decided it's sealed.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so why is it- How do you know it's sealed?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because we put it like that, with the top down.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so you put it with the top down.",F,Providing Feedback ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Mhmm.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So tell me why did this happen?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,We're still deciding on that.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. You might want to pick up this can to see what happened.,F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Pick it up?,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Yeah, pick it up. And kind of dump it out. Do you think the amount of water inside that can changed?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,As it boiled or as it-,F,,,,
,[You]:,"No. When you flipped it up, like right now, was there more water it in?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,No.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. So it didn't change much.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Maybe. Because if it was in there, water would flow in.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Why would it flow in?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Because it's open.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So you can maybe think about that, but let's think about why this crushed. Because I see a picture here, I see all sorts of movement of molecules.",F,Orchastrating Group Discussion,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,That's weird though.,F,,,,
,[You]:,What's weird?,F,Orchastrating Group Discussion,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,How did the air get out? How does it crush if the air didn't get out?,F,,,,
,[You]:,So what's inside the can in your picture right here?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,There's air and water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Air and water? Ok, so then when you flipped it over what happened?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Oh, wait. I didn't take all the air out though. There's still air and water in there.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so there's air and water still in here. What happened to it?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,[Silence],F,,,,
,[You]:,What do you think?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,[Silence],F,,,,
,[You]:,Did you take anything out of the can when you flipped it over?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,No.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so what happened to the stuff inside there?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It got- The water started coming down. The hot water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so- What?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The boiling water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,The boiling water went-,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It come out as you were putting it in. It was coming out.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so the hot water was down here, you flipped it over, and now it's down here.",F,,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Mhmm.,F,,,,
,[You]:,What else happened?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The can crushed. The water inside the can was released.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. So maybe some of the water came out. Is the water- and what else do you think happned?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The cold water and the hot water touuched.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. And-,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The reaction thing.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So, when cold water and hot water touch each other, what happens to it?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"It spins- it like, creates a tornado.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Hmm. How could that affect- how could that make the can crush?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,[silence],F,,,,
,[You]:,I want you to think about these gas molecules. You have these gas molecules moving around inside of there.,F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Mhmm.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"And they're moving all over, I see some big arrows. And then you flipped your can over. What do you think happned to those?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,What happened to it?,F,,,,
,[You]:,Yeah.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Um, they're still in there.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh, so maybe they could have turned into liquid a little bit?",F,,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Why would they have turned into liquid?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The steam got cold.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so they got cold and then maybe they condensed into liquid?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Oh, I see.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"So, how would that make it crush then?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Uh, because there's less- because there's no air no more. Causing it to turn into water.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It's confusing.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Yeah, it is confusing. But you can keep working through that. You guys have lots of good ideas, so keep trying to work through it together.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"So, you can do why the can is crushing too, but I want you to start thinking about what do you wonder about this, like, what parts of the experiment could you change? Is there anything that you think, like, might affect the can or make it crush more or less?",T,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The amount of water in the can.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. How could that affect it?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because we only put 15 milliliters, so it would probably crush more if we put more water.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Why?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,More steam.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. So why do you think more steam would make it crush more?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because, it also causes it to have less air inside the can.",F,,,,
