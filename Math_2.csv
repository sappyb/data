,T,"so, you need my help, or do you want to try it on your own first?",T,,,*Video begins after the group work has already started,
,S,"to input this, do I have to put this number?",F,okay.,Explore,"*Students are at tables doing group work ""Exploring"" ",okay
,T,"all right, you ready?",T,,Explore,"*Teacher goes around to tables and prompts discussing what was learned in the explore, Explain step",
,T,"well, if you want, we don't have to do the negative.",T,"all right, you ready?",Explore,,
,T,you want to do the negative?,T,,Explore,,
,S,yeah.,F,,Explore,,
,T,"okay, here we go.",F,,Explore,,
,T,put a little negative three above there.,T,,Explain,,
,T,"now you know I'm going to do two times negative three, which is?",T,,Explain,,
,S,negative six.,F,,Explain,,
,T,divide by three is?,F,,Explain,,
,S,negative two.,F,,...,,
,T,good. plus eight.,F,,,,
,S,six.,F,,,,
,T,positive six.,F,,,,
,S,oh.,F,,,,
,T,"now you're going to put in a zero and do the same thing, right?",T,,,,
,T,"ben, see what Chris did there.",T,,,,
,S,all right.,F,,,,
,T,"all right sir, it looks like you're being left out here, aren't you?",T,,,,
,S,no.,F,,,,
,T,"okay, you understand what they're doing?",F,,,,
,S,we're using slope.,F,,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,,
,T,"so all right, let me ... let me test you here. let's try number four. all right?",T,,,,
,S,"okay, number four.",F,,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,,
,T,"oh by the way guys, I like how you labeled them, like that.",T,,,,
,S,thanks.,F,,,,
,T,excellent job.,F,,,,
,T,"x minus nine, right?",T,,,,
,S,"minus nine, okay.",F,,,,
,T,so tell me how you would graph that?,F,,,,
,S,I would graph it like this.,F,,,,
,T,here we go.,F,,,,
,S,"I would go negative nine. so, one, two, three, four, five.",F,,,,
,T,now that's negative nine for that.,F,,,,
,S,uh huh.,F,,,,
,T,right?,F,,,,
,S,mm hm.,F,,,,
,T,that negative nine really is my y intercept.,F,,,,
,S,so then I go down.,F,,,,
,T,ah ha.,F,,,,
,S,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.",F,,,,
,T,good.,F,,,,
,T,and now my slope is one fourth.,T,,,,
,S,uh huh.,F,,,,
,T,so that means?,F,,,,
,S,"one, one, two, three, four.",F,,,,
,T,good job.,F,,,,
,S,"This times two is six. negative six. all right this is seven, ten, and sixteen this time.",F,,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,,
,S,is this right?,F,,,,
,T,"what's your question, Brandon?",F,,,,
,S,I don't even know how to do this. I don't get it.,F,,,,
,T,what about your partner here? she's doing an excellent job here.,F,,,,
,S,oh.,F,,,,
,T,"what, are you shy or something?",F,,,,
,S,"no, I just asked this guy and he said something else. I'm trying to figure this one out. how do you do this?",F,,,,
,T,"okay, let me go to this other group, guys. and if they can't do it, I'll be back in a few minutes to help you. all right?",T,,,,
,S,"Mister Ormsby, this is like the same thing as I did that one, right?",F,,,,
,T,okay. let's take a look here.,F,,,,
,S,"I mean, I know how to do this, but I don't know how to do the fractions.",F,,,,
,T,"I mean, a lot of these tables look great, now let's get them plotted here.",F,,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,,
,T,and we can see what it comes out to be.,F,,,,
,S,"so after we write them all down, we plot them on here?",F,,,,
,T,right.,F,,,,
,S,every single one?,F,,,,
,T,right. and then you're going to label them.,F,,,,
,T,"now if you +...if you don't mind, since this is equation one, just put a little one at the end of it. and equation two put a two at it [//] at the end of it. okay?",T,,,,
,S,all right.,F,,,,
,T,"brandon, you had a comment? question?",T,,,,
,S,I know how to do the regular ones but I don't know how to do the one with fractions. those are the ones that I have trouble with.,F,,,,
,T,"well, okay. well maybe you ought to go to Nick. sounds like Nick knows what he's doing.",F,,,,
,S,"no, I said that I have trouble on it.",F,,,,
,T,"okay, then maybe we ought to go to Ashley.",F,,,,
,T,what do we got going on here?,T,,,,
,S,we're done.,F,,,,
,T,sir?,T,,,,
,S,"well, we got done with all of those. we were going to call you but you were talking to them.",F,,,,
,T,trying to embarrass me here or something?,F,,,,
,S,of course not.,F,,,,
,T,uh huh.,F,,,,
,S,you're really slow. for these ones here +...,F,,,,
,T,"you're such a character, Nick.",F,,,,
,S,"for these, for the fractions we did the slope and then we made a table, and we're done.",F,,,,
,T,"and everybody here agrees, right?",F,,,,
,S,uh huh.,F,,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,,
,T,this one you didn't number. what number is that one?,T,,,,
,S,"uh, I think that was five.",F,,,,
,T,"that was five. that one's correct, so put a five there.",F,,,,
,T,"okay, I can safely assume that this one must be the four, right?",T,,,,
,S,that was five.,F,,,,
,T,or is this one the four? which one's the four?,F,,,,
,S,this one's two.,F,,,,
,T,which one's two?,F,,,,
,S,"four is negative nine, and up one is four.",F,,,,
,T,are you sure about that?,F,,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,,
,T,because this one is different,F,,,,
,S,"one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. oh no. this is four.",F,,,,
,T,ah. right.,F,,,,
,S,this one's two.,F,,,,
,T,"so do me a favor. erase the two, right, and label them right near the ends of the lines. because right there I can't tell which line you're talking about, right?",T,,,,
,S,right.,F,,,,
,T,put the four right there. okay? so both of those look excellent.,T,,,,
,S,six minus five.,F,,,,
,T,"number one, slope with two thirds starting at eight and this one is seven, right?",T,,,,
,S,mm hm.,F,,,,
,T,"uh oh. I don't like equation three because look, it's going down. that's a positive three.",T,,,,
,S,oh.,F,,,,
,T,it should be going...,F,,,,
,S,up.,F,,,,
,T,it should be angling up.,F,,,,
,T,I'll check that one later. okay?,T,,,,
,S,Mister Ormsby?,F,,,,
,T,here we go. yeah?,F,,,,
,S,we don't get number five.,F,,,,
,T,"number five. all right, first of all, you know the y intercept is what?",F,,,,
,S,negative five.,F,,,,
,T,all right. so put a dot on negative five.,F,,,,
,S,"one, two, three, four, five.",F,,,,
,T,good. we all agree on that?,F,,,,
,S,yes.,F,,,,
,T,"now, this is something so simple but very important. see in Algebra we get lazy sometimes, right? guess what number is in front of that.",T,,,,
,S,one.,F,,,,
,T,"a one, right? if the slope is one, what am I going to do? how do I make one a fraction?",F,,,,
,S,one over one.,F,,,,
,T,"all right, that's fine.",F,,,,
,T,"now remember slope is rise over one, right?",T,,,,
,S,mm hm.,F,,,,
,T,so one over one means I rise one and I go across one.,F,,,,
,S,there.,F,,,,
,T,that's it. that's the slope of one.,F,,,,
,T,"and this one's equation three, right? so put a three next to that.",T,,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,,
,T,"so number them, in other words, okay?",F,,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,,
,T,"because what that's going to do, that's going to help you when I ask these questions about each of the equations.",F,,,,
,T,"so as soon as you get that done, which you're almost done, you get them numbered, just move on to the next set of five.",T,,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,,
,T,all right?,F,,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,,
,T,all right.,F,,,,
,S,"so this is three fifths, negative ten?",F,,,,
,T,"okay. so wait a minute. you're doing negative five, right?",F,,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,,
,T,three times negative five is negative fifteen.,F,,,,
,S,negative fifteen.,F,,,,
,T,divided by five. negative three. minus ten?,F,,,,
,S,"is, um, negative, um, seven... oh, minus ten?",F,,,,
,T,negative three and a negative ten.,F,,,,
,S,"oh, um, thirteen.",F,,,,
,T,negative thirteen. so let's change that.,F,,,,
,S,mm hm.,F,,,,
,T,"well negative five is going to be, not five, but negative?",F,,,,
,S,thirteen.,F,,,,
,T,thirteen.,F,,,,
,T,get some help from them.,T,,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,,
,T,you think you got it? if I put in zero here what am I going to get?,F,,,,
,S,"uh, zero.",F,,,,
,T,"wait a minute, what's three fifths times zero?",F,,,,
,S,three fifths times zero?,F,,,,
,T,zero. minus ten would be?,F,,,,
,S,ten.,F,,,,
,T,zero minus ten would be?,F,,,,
,S,ten.,F,,,,
,T,not positive ten.,F,,,,
,S,negative ten.,F,,,,
,T,negative ten. so you want to put a negative ten there. okay?,F,,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,,
,T,now try at least one more of five. okay?,T,,,,
,S,"uh, Isn't that, uh...",F,,,,
,T,now it's a positive five.,F,,,,
