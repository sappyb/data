,,Teacher,"Oh you know what, let's remember that question that we talked about for the warm up.  What are some ways that fungi affect you? What did you put down?",TRUE,Explore,,
,,Student,They kill us,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,They can kill us? In what way?,FALSE,Explore,,
,,Student,Poisonous?,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Okay, so there are some that are poisonous. Yeah?",FALSE,Explain,,
,,Student,They grow on our feet and make it hard to find a date.,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Okay. Hey, great answer. For those unfortunate few of us. Yes?",FALSE,Evaluate,,
,,Student,They grow on our food.,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,They grow on our food. ,FALSE,Explain,,
,,Teacher,Any other ways they affect our lives?,TRUE,Explore,,
,,Student,They are food,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"They are food. Okay, Ollie? ",FALSE,Explain,,
,,Student,They gross us out.,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"They can do that, yeah.",FALSE,Explain,,
,,Student,"My brother doesn't like them, so he doesn't like them in his food.",FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Okay, so he just rolls it up and sticks it in there?",FALSE,Explore,,
,,Student,Yeah. It smells.,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"It smells. Let's see, how would they impact our life, like if we didn't have fungi in our world, would it be a better place? Would it not be a better place? Ben?",TRUE,Explore,,
,,Student,"It wouldn't be better because the cycle would be, cause we need to have things decompose.",FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Okay, so maybe we need things to help decompose, to be part of the cycle. ",FALSE,Explain,,
,,Student,We wouldn't have mac'n'cheese.,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"We wouldn't have mac'n'cheese, why? Why is that? How is that?",FALSE,"Explain, explore",,
,,Student,Because cheese is a fungus.,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,Cheese is a fungus maybe?,FALSE,Explore,,
,2:40,Teacher,"Okay so let's talk about some of these throughout this activity here. So as you go through these I want you to think about this question. There are a lot of different roles they play. And what type of organisms are affected by them? We already know obviously they affect us but are there other organisms that might be affected by them? Um, and then give me some examples, describe and give me some examples.",TRUE,Explore,,
,,Student,"Ew, it's bread mold. It can grow on many foods not just bread. It looks fuzzy and can be black, white, green, or grey colored.",FALSE,-,,
,5:21,Teacher,"So you guys were saying that they, looking at this, release enzymes that break down organic material. What does that mean, though?",TRUE,Explore,,
,,Student,They break down things like yeast and salt... And things that are organic. ,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"So if we didn't have some of things to break things down, what do you think it would look like? ",FALSE,Explore,,
,,Student,A big pile of dead... Compost. Not even rotting. ,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,Would they be rotting? ,FALSE,Explore,,
,,Student,"I don't think so. Because rotting requires fungi. I picture it as like a huge landfill. Not only fungus, but also bacteria also rocks. ",FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Oh okay, how do they feed it?",FALSE,Explore,,
,,Student,How do they feed it? Umm...,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Cause if you want to eat an apple, you don't just swallow a whole apple, right?",FALSE,Explore,,
,,Student,Yeah. So...,FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Take a look at how maybe, how...",TRUE,Explore,,
,,Student,"I think they kind of have acids in them, well, I don't know.",FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Rebecca was talking about how we've got things being decomposed, organic materials being decomposed. Are they similar?",TRUE,Explore,,
,,Student,"Maybe it breaks it down into a liquid and then soaks it up like it was water? Like a sponge. Then, since when it grows it needs more water to keep growing, it just breaks it down, sort of like our stomach. ",FALSE,-,,
,,Teacher,"Okay, so if we left that bread for a very very long time, what do you think would happen to that fungi?",FALSE,Explore,,
,7:18,Student,Probably be gone? I mean maybe the fungi would die out unless there was another food near it?,FALSE,-,,
