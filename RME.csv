,T,Have a little discussion with the person next to you for a few moments.,T,Having students work in groups,,Engage,Engage,
"oh, okay.",S,(students discuss for several minutes),F,-,,Explore,Engage,(have students work in groups)
,T,"So, we're trying to work out whether mum's right, or Isla's right. What do we think, who wants to come and try and convince the rest of us? Chris, do you want to try and convince us?",T,"Questioning and Prompting
",(getting ideas out),Explain,Explore,(facilitate students' discussion and comparison of ideas)
yeah.,S,"So, ten percent of fifty pounds is 5 pounds 60 because you divide it by 10. Because you want 20%, you have to times that by 2, which is 11 pounds 20, and then you have to add that on to the original price of 56 pounds equals 67 pounds 20 pents. So mum was right.",F,-,,Explain,Explore,
,T,So mum was right. Who else thinks mum was right?,F,Questioning and Prompting,(getting ideas out),Explain,Explore,
me.,S,(students raise hands),F,-,,Explain,Explore,
,T,Okay. Mikey you also think mum was right. ,F,,,Explain,Explore,
yeah.,S,"Yeah, there's a way that the girl could be right, cause she could've rounded that number to 70. 'Cause if you are rounding that means she would be right.",F,-,,Explain,Explore,
,S,"You could just go, I'll round it to make it 70",F,-,,Explain,Explore,
,S,"You could just be like, Oh, I think it's 70 but then when you pay for it...",F,-,,Explain,Explore,
,S,"It could have been an estimate, if it was.",F,-,,Explain,Explore,
,T,Whose was an estimate?,F,Questioning and Prompting,,Elaborate,Explore,
me.,S,"No, not the mum's ",F,-,,Elaborate,Explore,
,T,So you think there's about 70 pounds.,F,,,Elaborate,Explore,
there's about 70.,S,"Maybe because those prices on the stuff, so she's like, ah, they look like 70 pound.",F,-,,Elaborate,Explore,
,T,Those look like 70-pound jeans.,F,,,Elaborate,Explore,
Those look like 70-pound jeans.,S,Yeah.,F,-,,Elaborate,Explore,
,T,"Okay, so they might've estimated. ",T,,,Elaborate,Explore,
" that's a very good number to try with this one, right Nick?",S,I'm really confused.,F,-,,Elaborate,Explore,
,T,You're really confused. Why are you confused about it?,F,,,Elaborate,Explore,
because this is a one and only equation.,S,"Because it must be 20% of the original price taken off, so I don't know why you're adding 20% of that price onto it, because it would just be smaller.",F,-,,Elaborate,Explore,"(transition, where one student reflects on the last solution, questions the explanation)"
,T,So let's just pick what Abays just said. Why is he confused? Lorna. ,T,Questioning and Prompting,,Evaluate,Explain,(more emphasis on how different students solved it)
,S,"Because, it would have been 20% of the original price but Christian's done it where you add 20% to the end, the reduced price.",F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,T,Oh.,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,S,You have to do that to do the original price. ,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,T,We have to find the original price. ,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,S,And that's how you do it. ,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,T,"Well, as Christian's done it? ",F,Questioning and Prompting,,Evaluate,Explain,
,S,There's different ways. ,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,T,"Okay, who thinks they've got a different way then? Does anyone think that Eila was right?",F,Questioning and Prompting,,Engage,Explain,"(teacher continues to prompt to elicit students' ideas, prompts students to give evidence)"
,S,"Well it says it was this much, so you could always find out how much it was on the tag. ",F,,,Engage,Explain,
,T,Where does it say it was this much? ,F,Questioning and Prompting,,Engage,Explain,
,S,"Because, you know when you get discounts on things, it always says ""was...""",F,,,Engage,Explain,
,T,So you're saying we might not actually have to work this out if we look at the price ticket. ,F,,,Engage,Explain,
,T,"Okay, Nile, do you want to go up, then? Thank you, Christian.",T,Questioning and Prompting,,Engage,Explain,
,S,(student comes up),F,,,Engage,Explain,
,T,And did you just underline that 20% off?,F,,,Engage,Explain,
yeah.,S,Yes.,F,,,Engage,Explain,
,T,Why?,F,Questioning and Prompting,eliciting student reasoning,Engage,Explain,
I  made the graph.,S,"Because it's off, it's off the original price.",F,,,Engage,Explain,
,(other S),(students discuss),F,,,Explore,Explain,
,T,"Okay, well let's see, let's see. Let's see what Nile does and then we'll continue our discussion.",T,,,Explore,Explain,
"oh, okay.",S,"So we've said that 56 pounds that it's being reduced to, and because you're taking away 20%, so you get 80%, so you have to divide it, which would get you to 40%. And then divide it again which would get you to 20%, so 20% is 14, so you  just need to add those two together to get to 100%, which is 70, so it would be 70 pounds.",F,,,Explain,Explain,
,T,"I'm confused, because it looks like on the board there's just a lot of numbers. I'm struggling to see this.",F,,,Explain,Explain,
"okay, so maybe zero, three and six would be good numbers to try with this one, right",S,"There's no, are you adding or timesing those numbers? There's no add or subtraction or timesing. ",F,,,Explain,Explain,
,T,Could anyone draw a picture to accompany what Nile's just done?,T,,,Explain,Explain,
the slope.,S,(student raises hand),F,,,Explain,Explain,
,T,Do you want to draw a picture to accompany what Nile's just done?,F,,,Elaborate,Explain,
yeah.,S,Cause it's easy...,F,,,Elaborate,Explain,
,T,"Okay, let's just, I think we're starting to have a couple of little rumblings going on. ",T,,,Evaluate,Explain,
"oh, okay.",S,So 100% has to be 70 pounds.,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,S,(other students give comments),F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,S,"The starting price, that's not the original price, 56 pounds is...",F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,(other S),the estimate,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,S,"No, 56 pounds is 80%, so we can't find 20% by dividing it by 5.",F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,(other S),So I was right.,F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,S,"Yeah, because if we divide this by 5, which would be 20% if we're doing that way, that would be 16%, not actually 20%, 'cause this is that plus 80%.",F,,,Evaluate,Explain,
,T,"Okay, lots of stuff there and I think some of us is still trying to process what's going on. ",F,,,Evaluate,Elaborate,(teacher transitions to thinking about overall process)
okay.,T,"Leo, can you see the picture that Stefan's drawn, and can you make sense of what he's done?",T,,,Engage,Elaborate,
"the idea is I'm gonna graph on the table, and then plot the points from the table.",S,Umm...,F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
,T,Do you want to give us your interpretation?,F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
"I got's three in the middle. so, zero, three, six.",S,"Umm, so, he's found out 80% is 56 pounds.",F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
,T,"Where's that come from, where's that information come from?",F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
The paper.,S,"Because 20% they took of of 100%, and then, so 20% would be 14 pounds would be what they took from 70 which would make it 56 pounds, so that must mean that 20% is 14 pounds.",F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
,T,Okay. So we've got the 80%. How did we know it was 80%? Molly?,T,,,Engage,Elaborate,
"well, it's a two thirds fraction +...",S,"Because 20% of, 20% taken off was 80%?",F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
,T,Okay. So we've paid 80%. And what have we paid?,F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
nothing.,S,(no response),F,,,Engage,Elaborate,
,T,So what is this 20% and why are we trying to work that out? Christos?,T,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
it's negative three.,S,Um...,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,Or how have we worked it out?,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
We put in zero.,S,"Um, well...it's kind of confusing. ",F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,Do you want to try and ask a question that will help you be less confused?,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
okay.,S,"Oh right, he's divided it by 4 to get 20%.",F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,To get what?,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
three.,S,Eighty.,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,"Eighty, to get twenty. Why is he trying to find twenty?",F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
because he's a numbers expert.,S,"Um, because...",F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,(other S),(other student writes on board),F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,S,"Oh, because he's trying to get to a hundred.",F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,That's what's happening there? We're trying to get to a hundred? Really?,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
yeah.,S,"Yeah, because we need to find the full price but we've only got 80% and we need 20% to add on, so then because that equals a hundred, so then we'll be able to find the whole price.",F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,"Okay, so we're saying that Eila's correct. Are we all happy that Eila's correct? Why is mum not correct?",T,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
cause he's a liar.,S,She's a mum.,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,She's a mum! She should be right! ,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
oh.,S,Mum's are never correct.,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,Mum's are never correct?! ,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
they're all wrong.,S,My mum isn't.,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,Azan?,T,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
Mister Ormsby.,S,"Cause her mum found out 20% of the 20% off price, so she's just added 20% of the price that's been already have 20% taken off to the 20% price.",F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,And what should she have done?,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
put a negative three in there.,S,She should've divided the 80% by 4 to get 20% and then did that onto 56 pounds.,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
,T,Mkay. ,F,,,Elaborate,Elaborate,
"all right, so, okay, this is what I did. I put three 
negative three, zero",T,"I think this is a bit of a threshold concept to get your head around. It's tricky, yeah? Working out what we've got. What we've started with.",T,,,Evaluate,Evaluate,
three.,T,"So, it says draw a bar labeled with the information Levis are 20% off and have a price of 56. So I think we've just done that as a class. We've just decided that altogether.",T,,,Evaluate,Evaluate,
oh.,T,"So when Eila was working it out she drew this bar, which was slightly different to Stefan's bar. So can you tell me what's the same, what's different?",T,,,Evaluate,Evaluate,
"the same amount of times, right?",,,,,,,,
