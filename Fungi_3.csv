,,T,"What I'm going to have you do is try to use all the following key words here. These are some of the words that kinda came up when you were looking at the different types of fungi earlier, before break, um, digestion, decomposinig, nutriets, rotting. So I'd like you to try to use all those key words there to explain what you thinks happening over time in the ziploc bag with the strawberries. Yes, Alex, great.",TRUE,,
,,S,"Well, What's happening over time in the ziploc bag is the strawberries are rotting and decomposing. What's cauing this might be that the mold growing on it gathers the strawberries nutrients through digestion and the strawberry starts to shrivel up and break.",FALSE,,
,,T,Great. So you said what's happening is rotting and decomposing. Is that the same thing? That you're talking about you think? Or are they two different things that are going on? And this can be a question for anybody. Alex used it. I saw a lot of people using it. A lot of people said the stawberries were decomposing and rotting. Are those two different things that are happening? What do you say?,FALSE,,
,,S,"Yeah, I think it's two different things. Um, when they rot, the mold starts to grow on them to get the nutrients. But when they decompose then it, um, more of them are falling apart.",FALSE,,
,,T,But what's causing them to fall apart?,FALSE,,
,,S,"Well, the mold just being on the nutrients I guess.",FALSE,,
,,T,Ok. So depends on what you're saying. Same thing? Are they the same thing?,FALSE,,
,,S,"Well, I think it depends more, more than a ton. the last stage where it um falls apart and rotting",FALSE,,
,,T,Ok. So any other ideas? Tory?,TRUE,,
,,S,"Um, the mold is, I think that rotting is the mold taking out the nutrients like up to the surface so the mold can digest it. And decomposing is where the actual material of the strawberry starts to fall apart and become compost.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Because, what reason?",FALSE,,
,,S,"Because the mold is, all the nutrients are out of the strawberries so that’s basically what makes up the fruit",FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok. So I'm hearing kinda a couple of things here. It sounds like you and James have really similar ideas here, where you're saying that um, mold, or fungus, is the cause of both of those rotting and decomposing, but they're two different parts of the same overall thing, that you're saying, right?",FALSE,,
,,T,"Any other ideas? About whats going on inside here. Maybe we can add a couple of these ideas that you just talked about onto our concept map up here. So, you guys remember this? From back in the day? We put a lot of great ideas on here. Um, let's talk about what you guys just shared here. So we got decompose, take the goodness away, parts of a cycle, and add nutrients like compost. So, We're talking about decomposing and rotting maybe being two different topic things, maybe? Um, I'll add what you said two stages. Um, What I'm going to have you guys do is um, look up some of these words in picture pockets we have available here with the info, and see if you can get a better idea of some of the definitions of the words, because when I walked around a lot of people asked what does decomposing mean? Can you describe how do you digest food?",TRUE,,
,,S,I eat it.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Eat it! Yeah, can you describe that process for me?",FALSE,,
,,S,I chew it.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Or anybody else, you can help, how do you digest food?",TRUE,,
,,S,And then I swallow. And then it breaks it down.,FALSE,,
,,T,What breaks it down?,FALSE,,
,,S,Acids. In my stomach.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok, great. And then what? And then where does it go from there?",FALSE,,
,,S,It goes down in,FALSE,,
,,T,"Well, I mean, like you eat it and it breaks down. But I mean, why are you eating in the first place?",FALSE,,
,,S,To get energy.,FALSE,,
,,T,To give you energy. So how are you getting that energy after you break it down?,FALSE,,
,,S,By taking nutrients from the food.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok. Um, so then describe how fungus is doing that. Is that the same?",FALSE,,
,,S,They absorb it through their cell membrane.,FALSE,,
,,T,Are we kinda doing that too? We got lots of cells in our body and we're absorbing them kinda all of the cells within our body doing that?,FALSE,,
,,S,The germs frist break it down,FALSE,,
,,T,"They first break it down, ok. So how does this process here, is this process different from what we're doing?",FALSE,,
,,S,Yes.,FALSE,,
,,T,Why is it called extracellular? What does that mean?,FALSE,,
,,S,More cells?,FALSE,,
,,T,"No idea? Why don't you guys take a look at a couple more of these here. Just compare what they're saying about the extracellular, what are they doing here? So you want to kind of compare, maybe, most of them here to see if there might be any differences. Because some of them are really similar, but you might obtain more information by looking at one or two more.",FALSE,,
,,T,"So we talked about extracellular digestion already, yeah?",TRUE,,
,,S,Yeah,FALSE,,
,,T,What is it?,FALSE,,
,,S,The process where fungus breaks down food to simple sugars and absorbs with cellular membranes,FALSE,,
,,S,"No, no. It's the way fungus digests foods where enzyms break the organiz material into sugars and take the sugars into the cell membrane for energy.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Ah, interesting. So isn't that the same thing you're doing then? When you eat?",FALSE,,
,,S,Pretty much.,FALSE,,
,,T,Yeah? But how is that different though?,FALSE,,
,,S,We don't use enzymes?,FALSE,,
,,T,Do we? We actually do have enzymes inside of our body.,FALSE,,
,,S,"Oh, ok.",FALSE,,
,,S,We don’t have cell membranes?,FALSE,,
,,T,We do have cell membranes.,FALSE,,
,,T,"So you just described this process where fungus is releasing enzymes, they're breaking it down and they're absorbing it. How do we do it?",TRUE,,
,,S,We swallow it.,FALSE,,
,,S,We chew and swallow it first.,FALSE,,
,,T,"We chew and swallow it first, so how are these two processes different?",FALSE,,
,,S,This one is like straight to the stomach.,FALSE,,
,,T,So they have a stomach?,FALSE,,
,,S,Well they break it down first.,FALSE,,
,,T,What?,FALSE,,
,,S,They break it down first.,FALSE,,
,,T,"They break it down first, before they...",FALSE,,
,,S,"Like, swallow.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok. Well, what would that look like, if you wanted to, Lucy, I mean, I tell you eat like a fungus, here's a strawberry, eat like a fungus. What would you have to do?",TRUE,,
,,S,"I'd probably have to, um, I have no idea.",FALSE,,
,,T,"So, you have enzymes inside of your stomach, though.",FALSE,,
,,S,"Yeah, I'd probably have to cut open my stomach and use the enzymes to make me swallow.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok. And then the strawberries there, what do you do, to the strawberry?",FALSE,,
,,S,"Haha, probably go to the doctor's office.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok, stay focused, James, and then what happens? Since you released her enzyme, now what?",FALSE,,
,,S,"Um, the enzymes break down the organic material in the food.",FALSE,,
,,T,Any then what does Lucy have to do?,FALSE,,
,,S,I have to absorb it.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Ah, doesn't that kind of a graphic picture to think about? You have to expell something and then it gets broken down, and then you like get it back into your body somehow.",FALSE,,
,,S,Ew.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Yeah. Great, so I want you to make sure you're adding that definition here so that makes it a little more clear for you guys.",FALSE,,
,,T,"It looks good. Um, so what do we got here? Um, can you tell me some of the relationships that you saw? So start anywhere and then you can go from there.",TRUE,,
,,S,"Ok, nutrients to sugars, because nutrients are broken down into sugars.",FALSE,,
,,T,Great.,FALSE,,
,,S,"Um, enzymes to sugars, because um, releasing, the sugar is releasing enzymes or something",FALSE,,
,,T,Enzymes are releasing sugars?,FALSE,,
,,S,"Or something was, I can't really remember.",FALSE,,
,,T,"You might want to, um, look through a couple more to help you refine that a little bit.",FALSE,,
,,T,What did you get? Do you have something different?,TRUE,,
,,S,"Well, uh, that one I actually didn't write anything, but what happens is the enzymes are released then it breaks down the sugars to become nutrients.",FALSE,,
,,T,It breaks down sugars?,FALSE,,
,,S,Yeah.,FALSE,,
,,T,Are you sure?,FALSE,,
,,S,It breaks down organic stuff into simple sugars.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Oh, ok. So you're missing something there, so you might want to add that.",FALSE,,
,,S,"Oh, yeah.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Enzymes are breaking, so it's not breaking down sugar",FALSE,,
,,S,It's breaking things down into sugar,FALSE,,
,,T,Organic material into sugar. So what is organic materials? What are we talking about?,FALSE,,
,,S,like leaves.,FALSE,,
,,T,What about metal?,FALSE,,
,,S,"No, that's not organic, because it's made by people.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok, um, what about bread, people make bread.",FALSE,,
,,S,It's made out of organics,FALSE,,
,,T,"So I want you to make sure you're kinda double checking yourself here you're saying, oh yes I understand that enzymes are related to starches.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Um, these are the seven key words hat you looked at yesterday. And I asked you to draw some lines and explain some relationships between some of those words. So I would like to start off by reviewing that. Um, can I have someone maybe start us off here, start off with any of those words and maybe tell me one of the relationships you saw between that and maybe another word. I know eveyone has bluish chips so let's have more volunteers. Audry.",TRUE,,
,,S,"Well, we could connect enzymes to starches because the,",FALSE,,
,,T,"Enzymes to starches, ok.",FALSE,,
,,S,"Because the enzymes, um, actually break down the starches.",FALSE,,
,,T,"So Enzymes, what are enzymes?",FALSE,,
,,S,"Oh, they're the, well they're like the chemicals that the fungi releases to go break down.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Great. Yes. And as I'm going through it on here if you want to add anything else to your journal that you don't have, you might want to do that, too. So we got, um, Audry said it's released, some kind of a chemical, released by the fungi. And so we used to words decomposing and rotting kind of together, um, what's the relationship between those two words? I'm going to have you guys talk to the person next to you then I'm going to call on someone at random. So what's the relationship between decomposing and rotting.",FALSE,,
,,T,"If I can get your attention back up here. Do we have any other volunteers, would anyone like to volunteer to tell us what this relationship is? Carley?",TRUE,,
,,S,"Um, after it rots it decomposes",FALSE,,
,,T,After it rots it decomposes maybe? Ok.,FALSE,,
,,S,Yeah.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Any other ideas out there? How about, Alex?",FALSE,,
,,S,"Um, well, I'm kinda thinking about what Carley said I think after it decomposes it rots because maybe rotting is when it has lost all of its nutrients",FALSE,,
,,T,And decomposing would be…,FALSE,,
,,S,Decomposing is just when it's losing its nutrients.,FALSE,,
,,T,When you're losing it? Like in a process or something? Ok. Let's hear some others. How do you feel about decomposing or rotting,FALSE,,
,,S,"Look at it, what do you think it is?",FALSE,,
,,T,"I don't know, well you have to come up with a better definition. Is it the same thing? Or are they different?",FALSE,,
,,S,"I think decomposing is when it's starting to fall apart, and then rotting is just, um, leading up to it decomposing.",FALSE,,
,,T,"Aren't you still saying kind of the same things happening, maybe?",FALSE,,
,,S,"Well, yeah, but, when it's rotting it's still together, and when it decomposes it just,",FALSE,,
,,T,Ok.,FALSE,,
,,S,I think it's the other way around. Decomposing is like the breaking down of it and rotting is falling apart.,FALSE,,
,,T,"Ok. Um, I'm going to have you guys think about this. Decomposing, a lot of you guys ar defininf decomposing as, um, things being broken down. And some of you said rotting is something that's broken down already, too. So, in both of these processes here, what's breaking these things down? What's breaking the food or the trees or the plants down? We'll start off with you.",FALSE,,
,,S,(inaudible),FALSE,,
,,T,"Fungi, ok. Let's conocentrate on the fungi part. And fungi is doing this how?",FALSE,,
,,S,By (inaudible),FALSE,,
,,T,"Great. So we're doing this process here that we talked about. So this final stage after its gotten its nutrients, this whole kind of process is a description of decomposing, its kind of describing the whole process of extracellular digestion. We're seeing things decompose. And it's really so much a rotting too, things are being broken down, a lot of you were saying that. So these processes, decomposing and rotting, are pretty much the same thing, if you're looking at this, and it's hanging out in your fridge, that same process of enzymes breaking structures down into sugars is happening, isn't it? What do you guys think? Yeah? Can you guys see it happening here? Um, so, we're talking about decomposing and rotting kinda being a similar thing.",FALSE,,
,,S,"When we said that it was losing nutrients when it was rotting and decomposing, um, I don't think it is really losing nutrients, because we, because some people, like when they're done with their fruit or something and they don't want the rest they put it in a compost bin. And when it turns into compost, they use that for plants because it has good nutrients. So I don't think it loses nutrients.",FALSE,,
,,T,Ok. But does it have the same amount oof nutrients it started off with?,FALSE,,
,,S,I don't know.,FALSE,,
,,T,"So then what's happening then? It will probably have less nutrients, because we're talking about the fungus is getting some of the nutrients from that food. Does that make sense?",FALSE,,
