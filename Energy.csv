,T,"Ok, so what we're going to do is we're going to turn these burners on pretty high and we're going to see what happens. So just like we always do, before we start I'm going to ask you to make a prediction about what you think will happen. And today is one of those days, if you saw a learnign target and ou wrote it down, that will be able to record and share my ideas. Today is one of those idea days where it does not matter what you write down so long as it's about this. Alright, so I'm not expecting you to know all the answers to all the questions I'm asking today, but I am expecting you to try to answer them. Ok? So do the best you can.",T,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,This paper that I'm about to pass out will guide you through that process. The first thing I want you to do when you get this is fold it in half so that it looks like this. The only reason I'm asking you to do this is is that it makes it a little less overwhelming and it will help you focus on the ones that we're filling out.,T,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,I need this row and this row right here to step up to these cabinets and that box and grap a pair of goggles and safety glasses. Make sure that they're comfortable and they fit your face.,T,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,"We have got on the very very top line it says zero minutes soda is frozen. So the 7-Up, I turned it up a little too high, it's actually not frozen anymore, but I want you to draw in that picture where the level of the soda is. I want you to use zoom-in circles to draw what the molecules of anything here that you want to draw. So you might draw, for example, the frozen coke in the flask. You might draw the air in the empty glass. You might draw the cold ice water or the ice inside of that bottle that's keeping it cold. You might draw the glass, a zoom-in of the glass. You decide. Then I'm asking you to predict what will happen with the soda. So you're just telling me what you think will happen. You got a little bit of a preview there, so you might have an idea.",T,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,"The soda begins to melt. So if you look at the Coke, there is some liquid Coke and some frozen Coke. It's like an iceburg. So I want you to think, how could now draw a zoom-in of that liquid that's melting in there.",T,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,"It happened again! But I just put it back, why is that happening?",T,,
,S,Because gas.,F,,
,T,"So, Luke just told us we have switched already for the 7-Up, it's already boiling. So it's already- I'm going to turn it down just a little bit.",F,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,What is happening here?,T,,
,S,There's no more gas.,F,,
,T,What do you see?,F,,
,S,Air.,F,,
,T,Maybe you draw a zoom-in and it shows the steam. What would those molecules look like? Make sure you label all your zoom-ins.,F,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,"Ok, hey! Something else just happened. That just went past my arm and it's hot. So that's something else that happened, that's information that I was hoping to get.",T,,
,S,[silence],F,,
,T,"Ok, so I'm going to ask a really good question. Let me ask, what happens if you take it off, will it still boil? Look it's still boiling. Why do you think that is?",T,,
,S,Those are big molecules.,F,,
,T,I heard carbonation. I heard molecules. What is your explanation? Zoom-in on those bubbles maybe or write it in.,F,,
,T,"Draw a zoom-in symbol there. See how David's drawing the level of the soda in? When it's frozen? So now I want you to draw a zoom-in circle that shows what the molecules would look like if you zoom way way in. That's fine. Just draw a little point. Show where you're drawing it to and from and show what these molecules look like, so what's the movement like? How are they arranged? How much space between them?",T,,
,S,Like this?,F,,
,T,Yes.,F,,
,T,"So somebody just shared an idea with me. They said, they're talking about the steam so they said the reason something's going through this tube is the steam is pushing it up so it doesn't have anywhere else to go. And I said, ok, so what's going to happen when the steam gets to the cold flask? ok? May I share your idea? So Alicia said, because she thinks it's going to be water again. So it's going to look like water.",T,,
