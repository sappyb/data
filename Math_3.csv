,T,right?,T,,,(students working in groups)
,S,yeah.,F,,Explore,(teacher going from group to group)
,T,"so it's going to be... well, what's three times a positive five? fifteen.",F,,Explore,
,S,"yeah, fifteen.",F,,Explore,
,T,divided by five is?,F,,Explore,
,S,three.,F,,Explore,
,T,three minus ten.,F,,Explore,
,S,seven.,F,,Explain,
,T,negative seven. don't forget the negative.,F,,Explain,
,S,"negative seven. oh, all right.",F,,Explain,
,T,okay?,F,,,
,T,all right guys. thanks for waiting so long.,T,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,T,"all right, you want me to just check the answers?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"now the only favor I need you to do, is because for each of these numbered equations, just number them. for example, this is one, correct?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,this one was equation three.,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,this one was equation five. so near the end of each of these arrows +...,F,,,
,S,"yeah, put the number?",F,,,
,T,"just put ... put the number. and then this one, let me just make sure, because I don't have them all memorized.",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"let's see, negative nine was one fourth. you've got the slope perfect there and this one was three fifths, right?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,so everything looks perfect.,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,just number them and move on to the next five.,F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,T,okay?,F,,,
,S,"Mister Ormsby? we're on number six. I got it, guys. check our answers. so here's all of number five.",T,,,
,T,"look at that excellent work, man.",F,,,
,T,excellent work.,F,,,
,S,"I crossed it out. there's one, there's two, there's three, and there's four and there's five. I figured it out.",F,,,
,T,excellent.,F,,,
,S,but it... they're having problems on number... oh there it is. I found it.,F,,,
,T,okay. you know what? as a matter of fact I think it's time for me to address the whole class.,F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,T,"everybody. ladies and gentlemen, listen up. ",T,,,"(teacher addresses whole class, all groups start listening to teacher)"
,S,(chattering),F,,,"(assesses progress, gives hint/reminder for equations 6 through 10; elicits student response)"
,T,"five, four, three, two, one, zero.",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"now, about half of you are about ready to start the next set of five, right? starting on number six?",F,,,
,S,"yep, that's what we're doing. we're starting...",F,,,
,T,"let me give you a hint. just a little reminder, what you will notice...",F,,,
,S,(chattering),F,,,
,T,"julie, you're doing a great job but please listen, okay? you'll notice on equations six through ten the slopes are negative.",F,,,
,S,"yep, all xxx.",T,,,
,T,all right?,F,,,
,T,"so therefore, instead of rise over run meaning you'd go up and to the right, with the negative you're going to instead go, down and to the right.",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,okay? does that make sense to everybody?,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,so please keep going. please make sure I check your first five and give you the okay to move on.,F,,,
,T,okay?,T,,Explore,"(students continue working in groups; teacher goes from group to group, asking students about their work)"
,S,all right. could you check ours?,F,,,
,T,yeah.,F,,,
,S,"actually, I'm on four.",F,,,
,T,I'll check yours real quick. ,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"okay. all right, good. you guys numbered them?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"there's one, slope. equation three, two thirds.",F,,,
,T,equation five looks good.,T,,,
,S,I haven't even gotten to five. I'm already...,F,,,
,T,okay. then you've got four and two.,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,it looks perfect so far.,F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,T,move on to equation six then.,F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,
,T,now you're saying you're being left behind here a little bit? on which one?,T,,,(teacher starts working with individual student at a group table)
,S,"well, they're obviously on five and +...",F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,S,we're on...,F,,,
,T,"now Robert, here, I'm sure can help you. you've got one of the smartest kids in class right here.",F,,,
,S,"he's tried to explain it once, but I'm not so sure.",F,,,
,T,"okay. it looks like you made a nice table here, though. you understand what you did there?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"okay. so when you put in zero, one fourth times zero is what?",F,,,
,S,zero.,F,,,
,T,minus nine is?,F,,,
,S,negative nine.,F,,,
,T,"okay. then you tried four, right?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,all right. why did you pick four and eight? why didn't you pick like one and two and three? numbers like that?,F,,,(eliciting reasoning behind student's strategy)
,S,because they're divisible by four.,F,,,
,T,well said. good job.,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"so when I try four, see, what's one fourth times four? just one +...",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,minus nine is a negative eight.,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,and then you put an eight. one fourth of eight is?,F,,,
,S,two.,F,,,
,T,minus nine is negative seven. so that's perfect.,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,if you plot those three points you get exactly what is on your graph there. okay?,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,alright,T,,,
,S,can I see this really quick? Mister Ormsby?,F,,,
,T,guys...,F,,,(other students at same table want teacher to help with certain questions)
,S,are you sure this is right? because you're all...,F,,,
,T,"oh, so you want me to just check six real quick, right?",F,,,
,S,"and five. five, because that's the one we messed up on.",F,,,
,T,right. five now looks perfect.,F,,,
,S,no three. three was...,F,,,
,T,"oh, three was the one we messed up on. ",F,,,
,S,yeah,F,,,
,T,"so three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope, which you did perfectly.",F,,,
,S,all right.,F,,,
,T,so three is good.,F,,,
,T,"let's go back to six... since we're here. here's six, so you started at positive eight.",T,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"the slope is negative five thirds so you went down five and over three, didn't you?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,perfect.,F,,,
,S,all right.,F,,,
,T,okay?,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,T,"Ashley, how is Brandon doing here? Brandon?",T,,,(teacher moves to new table)
,S,I'm helping him. ,F,,,
,T,Good.,F,,,
,S,I'm helping,F,,,
,T,that's what I want to see.,F,,,
,S,the rest... we're done. we just want you to check.,F,,,
,T,"all right, you keep helping Brandon.",F,,,
,T,"let me meet with Ashley over here. Nick, if you want to watch you can.",T,,,
,S,okey dokey.,F,,,
,T,"but I can tell you right now, five is good.",F,,,
,S,okay.,F,,,"(other student explaining to another student in separate conversation: S: and you see the pattern in eight and ten? S: if I put [//] how many do you add for ten? S: yeah, you've got to do twelve.)"
,T,okay? let me start in order here. one looks good.,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"hold it. wait a minute. let me check one again. one, the slope is two thirds, isn't it? ",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,right?,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,so first of all our y-intercept is eight.,F,,,
,S,"wait, wait.",F,,,
,T,"Ashley, let's look at yours since you're more comfortable with yours.",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"you agree that zero, eight should be my first point, right?",F,,,
,S,mm hm.,F,,,
,T,"two, four, six, eight. okay. that's good. three...",F,,,"(other student in nearby conversation: S: hold on Brandon. S: yep, Jessie.)"
,S,"I made one over three. one, two, three.",F,,,
,T,"oh, here's your mistake. all right? now watch Ashley, you ready?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"when I put in three, two times the three would be six...",F,,,
,S,six. oh yeah.,F,,,
,T,divided by three would make?,F,,,
,S,two.,F,,,
,T,"two. six divided by three is two, right?",F,,,
,S,I know it's two.,F,,,
,T,"okay, plus eight would make, ten. so three would be ten; well what's two plus eight?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"ten. so if that's a ten, this one I'm sure has got to be something bigger. okay?",F,,,
,S,eleven. twelve? this may be twelve.,F,,,
,T,I believe it's twelve.,F,,,
,S,"yeah, see I did it on here, but I did it wrong on my paper.",F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,S,it's weird.,F,,,
,T,"all right, so it sounds like you guys didn't compare your answers here.",F,,,
,S,m-hm.,F,,,
,T,But I think that's your only mistake. because equation three looks very good. all right.,F,,,
,T,you know what? equation two I don't necessarily like either. is this supposed to be two?,T,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,two says we're starting at what number?,F,,,
,S,negative ten.,F,,,
,T,"negative ten, right?",F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"you're not starting at negative ten here. what's this number? two, four... somehow you're starting at negative six. so what happened on equation two, guys?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"hey, how come we didn't use your table?",F,,,
,S,"I don't know. we were looking at his. so if we start at ten, then...",F,,,
,T,"oh, I know, look what you did wrong. you copied the equation down wrong.",T,,,
,S,that's number four.,F,,,
,T,"oh, I'm sorry. you're right. my mistake.",F,,,
,S,"oh yeah, it does start at six.",F,,,
,T,I can't even read your writing.,F,,,
,T,"yeah, why is that a six? that should be a negative ten, right?",F,,,
,S,it looks like a six but it's ten.,F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,T,and five you got negative seven.,T,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,I agree with that.,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,"okay, and then ten you got negative four. okay, so why don't you try replotting those three points and move on to equation six through ten and I'll check on number two later on.",F,,,
,S,alright.,F,,,
,T,"okay, the rest of them look pretty good, though. alright?",F,,,
,S,"Mister Ormsby, whoo hoo.",F,,,
,T,"okay, what are we doing here, guys?",T,,,(teacher moves to next group)
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"hey, how come none of these lines are labeled?",F,,,
,S,whoops.,F,,,
,T,now what I suggest you do +...,F,,,
,S,xxx two lines.,F,,,
,T,"hold on. what I suggest you do before I come back is for each of these [//] just call it equation one, two, three, four, and five, right?",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,put a number at the end of each of these lines.,F,,,
,S,"oh, like number one, two, three +...",F,,,
,T,"like for example, number one... uh oh. wait a minute.",F,,,
,S,look what you made me do.,F,,,
,T,I don't like what I see here.,F,,,
,S,you probably thought of it wrong.,F,,,
,T,okay.,F,,,
,T,"let's see here. number one, I believe this is supposed to be your number one here, right?",T,,,
,S,I think so. I don't know.,F,,,
,T,"how come it's going down, guys?",F,,,
,S,"I don't know, it does it.",F,,,
,T,aren't all these slopes positive? so all of these should be going up.,F,,,
,S,how's it going down?,F,,,
,T,look at it. it's going down.,F,,,
,S,it's going up.,F,,,
,T,"how do you read a book? how do you read a book, sir?",F,,,
,S,left to right.,F,,,
,T,you read from left to right. so let's start on the left side of the line.,F,,,
,S,yeah.,F,,,
,T,and as I move to the right I'm going in which direction?,F,,,
,S,down.,F,,,
,T,"right. now if you look at all the other lines, see they're all positive.",F,,,
,S,but it's going up.,F,,,
,T,sir you have to read from left to right. okay?,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,all right.,F,,,
,S,it's going down like that.,F,,,
,T,"so, guys, you need to make those corrections. label the line.",T,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"correct this one, at least.",F,,,
,S,how come we've never done this before?,F,,,
,T,okay?,F,,,
,S,you made me do it... could you check our answers for...,F,,,
,T,"oh my gosh. let me make sure I keep track of the time, too. all right.",T,,,(teacher moves to next group)
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,hey you guys did an awesome job here.,F,,,
,T,okay. let's take a look here. so here's your number six right?,T,,,"(checking work, doesn't find errors, so few student responses)"
,S,uh huh.,F,,,
,T,and you started at eight and the slope was negative five thirds so you went down five and over three.,F,,,
,S,uh huh.,F,,,
,T,that line looks perfect. let's look at your number seven. here's negative one. you went down four and over one.,F,,,
,S,m-hm.,F,,,
,T,there's your line there. that looks perfect.,F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,let's check number eight real quick.,F,,,
,S,"all right, I think I did it kinda +...",F,,,
,T,"oh, that's the eight, right? okay? so on number eight you started at twelve and negative one third. looks perfect.",F,,,
,S,(silent),F,,,
,T,"number nine is fourteen, which is where?",F,,,
,S,it's all the way up here.,F,,,
,T,way at the very top. and negative three halves means you went down three.,F,,,
