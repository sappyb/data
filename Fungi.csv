19:14:51,23:59:31,student,It's too cold. Yeah it was cold outside.,sir. Unit today.,
19:14:56,23:59:36,teacher,"Um, we’re gonna start our fungi unit today, um, I hadn’t quite finished all of your exams, prepping your exams on Friday, but I will be done pretty soon. I’m hoping to get done by the end of this week.","I haven't quite finished all of your exams, pressing your exams on Friday but I will be done pretty soon. I'm hoping to get done by the end of this week.",
19:15:35,0:00:16,teacher,"um, so let me show you the fungi unit, and so I have one warm-up question for you and its “where have you seen fungi?” jot down a couple of ideas.","So we're showing the fall guy, you know, and so I have one more question for you to get",
19:15:41,0:00:22,teacher,"Ok, so where’s places where you might have seen fungi?",,
19:15:52,0:00:33,student,In my backyard,the job done a couple of ideas.,
19:15:52,0:00:33,teacher,"Great, in your backyard where though?",,
19:16:00,0:00:41,student,"Um, towards the mossy area, it’s hard to explain.",,
19:16:08,0:00:49,teacher,"Towards like the corner, or is it on…",Where's the places that you might see in your background where though.,
19:16:14,0:00:55,student,A bunch of mushrooms,It takes,
19:16:29,0:01:10,teacher,"Oh, a bunch of mushrooms, in the hay.",just like a quarter or is it.,
,,student,"Something weird on its ..., its like a disease, that’s what the doctors say.",,
19:16:29,0:01:10,teacher,"Oh, what’d it look like?","Okay. Oh bunch of us in today,",
19:16:27,0:01:08,student,It was weird looking ...,what it looks like.,
,,teacher,"Oh ok, so you didn’t get to see what it looked like but you know it was growing on its butt?",---,
,,student,Like mushrooms on the trees in the woods.,---,
,,teacher,"Ok, so in the natural environment?","Okay, so you can see what it looks like. But, you know, that was going on it's but yeah, like, what grows on trees in the world. Right. It's enough in like the natural environment.",
19:16:32,0:01:13,student,Those weird things that stick out of the sides of trees.,,
19:16:46,0:01:27,teacher,"Ok, so on trees.",,
,,student,"Um, on decrepit logs",,
,,teacher,What do you mean (?),The weird things it's okay to on trees to give,
,,student,"Like just rotted, like, like falling apart ... the fungi ...",,
,,teacher,"Ok, any other places? Yeah, Diana?",,
,,student,In the grass in my front yard.,,
19:16:52,0:01:33,teacher,In the back of your car?,To on trees to give me maybe like just rotten like we're talking about breaking down into the,"(last part after fungi is unintelligible, someone is coughing)"
19:17:05,0:01:46,student,"No, no. In the grass in my front yard.",same language like we're halfway.,
19:17:14,0:01:55,teacher,"Oh, the grass, ok great.","Okay, listen genuine",
19:17:22,0:02:03,teacher,"So we’ve seen fungi, um, sometime in our life, uh, whether it’s on food or in nature like on trees or whatnot, we’re gonna be looking at more examples today too, so we have activity 42 for you. So I want you to show me that’s one of the things as you’re going around, um, oh actually as it- as you’re working at your lab station. And at your lab station what you’ll find are some colored pictures of different types of fungi, so there are twelve different types that you can look through. Um, a good idea is to have all the pictures spread out at your lab station so you can look at all of them together. And there are different bins with different types of things in them. So for instance, this station here has um, some fruit, that has uh, fungi growing on them. So you’ll make some observations uh about some of the things you see here. Remember we’re practicing our observations like we did at the beginning of the day. So uh, what kinds of things can you observe when you’re looking at these?","in the back of your car, and the grass and my friend, oh and the grass. Okay, Great. So we've seen fun guy, some time in our life, whether its food or the nature like on trees and whatnot.",
19:17:29,0:02:10,student,"Uh, that they’re really old and not healthy.",They have been looking at some more examples of fun guy today too. So we have activity 42 for you. So I want you to start thinking about some of these things as you're going around.,
19:17:37,0:02:18,teacher,"Yeah, so you’re making observations like that, some visual observations that maybe make- it also you can maybe make some guesses about what you think is happening inside some of these things too. So this station here has, um, fruit with mold on it. Um, I’ve got another station with mushrooms on it. Um, another one with petri dishes with mushrooms on them. And I think, um, some fungi growing as well. So, you can take a look- oh and bread, bread growing, uh, mold growing on bread. So when you’re uh, when you’re looking at the different bins here you’re looking at some of the different type of fungi um, and when you’re done, um, I’m going to give every group maybe about six or seven minutes. I’d like the team managers up at the front to kinda keep an eye on the clock, so at about every six or seven minutes I’d like you to take your bin and pass it to the next station, we’ll go in this order.","Oh actually as it, as you're working at your landscaping.",
19:17:41,0:02:22,student,"oh, oh","And I love this picture what you'll find are some colored pictures of different types of fog so there are 12 different types, types here that you can look through a good ideas have all your picture spread out on your lab station so you can look at all",
19:17:55,0:02:36,student,I can smell the pepper,"together. And there are different bins with different types of things in them so for instance, this station here has some fruit that has a punk I growing on it.",
19:18:05,0:02:46,student,"That is, that is grody","So you will make some observations about some of the things that you see here, remember we're practicing our observations, but we did gain the year.",
19:18:19,0:03:00,student,So is this,So what kinds of things can you observe when you're looking at.,
19:18:19,0:03:00,student,"Oh god, that’s strawberries","The only non healthy. Yeah, so you're making observations like that some visual observations that maybe make it also you can maybe make some guesses about what you think is happening inside some of these things too.",
19:18:28,0:03:09,student,Ew,"So this section here has fridge, with mold on it. I've got another station with mushrooms on it.",
19:18:35,0:03:16,student,Let’s see the pictures,"Another one with petri dishes mushrooms on, and I think I'm some fun guy growing as well. So, you can take oh and bread, bread growing mold growing on bread.",
19:18:46,0:03:27,student,"Ok, dude this is squishy",So when you're when you're looking at the different bins here. you're looking at some of the different types of pocket.,
19:18:53,0:03:34,student,It is?,"And when you're done. I'm going to give every group, maybe about six or seven minutes, I'd like the team managers up at the front to kind of keep an eye on the clock so out about every six or seven minutes, I'd like you to take your bid and pass to the",
19:19:07,0:03:48,student,Whoa,next station will go in this order here.,
19:19:16,0:03:57,student,"Ew, it looks like its like growing little- Oh I forgot my pencil at my desk","Oh, my",
19:19:16,0:03:57,student,Doesn’t all fungus have to grow on stuff?,God.,
19:19:25,0:04:06,student,"Yes you have, it’s like everywhere in the forest",Okay. Do this question is.,
19:19:32,0:04:13,student,Oh yeah,"Okay, It looks like it's a little touchy.",
19:19:46,0:04:27,student,"So where can you find fungi, growing on stuff?",,
19:19:49,0:04:30,student,"Bread, trees",Everyone. Oh yeah.,
19:19:52,0:04:33,student,Basically growing on stuff,Oh yeah. So where can you find,
19:19:56,0:04:37,student,Wait what about that nacho thing?,going on stuff.,
19:20:00,0:04:41,student,"Other things, growing on other things, like berries, trees","Read. Basically, rolling on stuff",
19:20:11,0:04:52,student,"Yeah, well I had- food",growing on other things,
19:20:16,0:04:57,teacher,Which part are you working on?,like berries tree.,
19:20:40,0:05:21,student,We’re working on ...,"Can you maybe describe you guys know some examples. Like, they make.",
19:20:47,0:05:28,teacher,"Ok, so you have a good list here, where are you getting this list from?",They make food.,
19:20:49,0:05:30,student,From the ...,They need they need food.,
19:20:53,0:05:34,teacher,"Ah, so your journal is a helpful tool, huh? Ok, so can you maybe describe what you guys know, some examples (?), like they, they made food, what do you mean by that, oh they make food, so you’re saying that-","They need to they don't make your own, you know, you know for sure. So, No, they do.",
19:21:16,0:05:57,student,"No we need food, we need, in our ...","Well, they may be",
19:21:10,0:05:51,teacher,"Oh they need food, so they don’t make their your own. How do you know? Do you know that for sure?",out of the ground.,
19:21:13,0:05:54,student,"No, it’s something they do. Photosynthesis.",Okay.,
19:21:24,0:06:05,teacher,What are some examples? How do you know they make their own food? What are you basing it off of?,"So, getting the nutrients. We know that plants make their own.",
19:21:34,0:06:15,student,"Because, well they, normally they always have something- they’re always arguing, they always pretend they’re not growing out of the ground ...",We,
19:21:30,0:06:11,teacher,"Ok, so they- yeah, what’d you say?",cannot How are they eating good food.,
19:21:44,0:06:25,student,It needs a host so it becomes a host.,"Like it, like disappears after a while and the bacteria is just left.",
19:21:53,0:06:34,teacher,"Um, so, how is it getting the nutrients from it. We know that plants make their own food. We eat food, we eat it with our mouth, how are they eating their food?",Hold on it.,
19:21:56,0:06:37,student,"I don’t know, they eat bacteria.",It'll be anywhere.,
19:22:12,0:06:53,student,Decomposes.,Spread spread around the brand live on all different hosts.,
19:22:28,0:07:09,teacher,What do you mean by that?,that's where,
19:22:32,0:07:13,student,"Like, like, like it disappears after a while and the bacteria’s just left.","I'm assuming this is like maybe in a water climate adaptation to for what reason to live like to gain some it might be, yeah.",
19:23:04,0:07:45,teacher,"Oh, ok, so that’s like when you have this piece of bread, like we have this bread here with a lot of mold on it, um-",I think,
19:22:55,0:07:36,student,"...it will be just fungi, there won’t be any bread.",that might be something that might be.,
19:23:15,0:07:56,student,If there’s no more bread we won’t have ...,You'll be.,
19:23:22,0:08:03,teacher,"What about some of the other ones, how do they adapt?",You'll be like,
19:23:22,0:08:03,student,Well I think-,Paul in small.,
19:23:29,0:08:10,student,"You see it spread, you see it spread, it like spreads around the bread.","Kael moving on to the next part are some basic things,",
19:23:39,0:08:20,student,They’re all different hosts and they have to adapt to the different host.,thinking about that listen. We need to make sure how they be.,
19:23:46,0:08:27,teacher,"Ok, can you give me an example that you might have seen, or?",I'm pretty sure my addition goes,
19:23:55,0:08:36,student,"well, the difference between some of the mushrooms, is like, I think that’s the fungi on this one, and that’s way different between- from say this example, and I’m assuming this is maybe in a wetter climate.","to eat dead organisms, but it's a mushroom.",
19:23:59,0:08:40,teacher,So these adaptations are for what reason?,"Yes, but he",
19:24:03,0:08:44,student,"Uh, to live, like, to survive.",did,
19:24:07,0:08:48,teacher,To gain some of the nutrients it might need?,not always,
19:24:16,0:08:57,student,Yeah.,"work,",
19:24:20,0:09:01,teacher,"Um, what about, how do they reproduce?",known as,
19:24:28,0:09:09,student,I think it’s binary fission.,Like because it's like alive.,
19:24:32,0:09:13,teacher,"Just like what we talked about with uh ..., so that might be something that might be something that’s listed where how are fungi different from plants, you know, like, they reproduce kind of like plants reproduce.","Okay, somebody is talking about before that.",
19:24:36,0:09:17,teacher,Plants reproduce by binary fission,He kept saying that mushrooms are living organisms and like is that they don't feed on dead or something like that.,
19:24:45,0:09:26,student,"No, No. They did the, Pollen. The pollen spreading. Pollination.",That will make can make them like cannibal.,
19:24:50,0:09:31,teacher,"So are we moving on to the next part where it’s basic things they need to survive, just so you guys are already thinking about that list and that might be a good idea, you can use that to-","Well, I thought that machine.",
19:24:55,0:09:36,student,We need to make sure how they reproduce.,"Yeah, let me like what are some examples, seen them growing on decaying what anywhere on old food like wet, wet cold climate places like one time I took a bunch of sand and sharing and water and everything.",
19:25:14,0:09:55,student,How do they reproduce?,"And then I put in an airtight container and in like two days smoke started to go. Yeah, how to get there.",
19:25:21,0:10:02,student,"I’m pretty sure it’s binary fission, because remember when we did all that bacteria stuff.","I think it's like because of the climate. And I think it's like a think it's being like, very scary like along, and then it kind of like emerges like grows.",
19:25:33,0:10:14,student,"Yeah, but it’s different from that bacteria stuff.","What do you say like, but then how come it wasn't growing when you first, because it's not a.",
19:25:38,0:10:19,student,It eats dead organisms,Maybe they don't like that habitat so they say Hannon. So what are some things that maybe all all one guy needs in order to like you've heard,
19:25:51,0:10:32,student,"But, but a mushroom’s only ...","Like, what.",
19:25:55,0:10:36,student,"Yes, but it eats dead- it eats the dead organisms","Okay, so the teachings are basically going back to where did you keep on when you I've kept them on my windowsill but there's like a bunch of trees bucking wind is also not like comes in dark areas and colder to show my kids in the forest is usually not",
19:26:10,0:10:51,student,Not always,"that much my and my, I went with my family were looking for, edible mushrooms, and they like all grew in the, in the shadows.",
19:26:22,0:11:03,student,He’s confusing me,Why would they grow into areas.,
19:26:24,0:11:05,student,There’s also food-,So I had to happen.,
19:26:28,0:11:09,student,"The yeast is alive, like yogurt.","I mean, like, think about plants plants grow and survive and get sunlight and whatnot. What, why would it feel like a grown like WeChat one thing I didn't getting anything from you",
19:26:47,0:11:28,student,The yeast is alive until it got eaten.,want to witness,
19:26:47,0:11:28,teacher,"Yogurt, what do you mean?",that they need.,
19:26:53,0:11:34,student,"Like, because it’s alive, but not alive alive.",So when you talk about a lot of excitement.,
19:26:57,0:11:38,teacher,"Oh, ok. So what were you guys talking about before that?",As you're going back through this maybe you can add to those ideas that you just talked about to somebody else you,
19:27:10,0:11:51,student,"Um, he he kept saying that mushrooms are living organisms and like they don’t feed on dead organisms, or something like that.",kind of touched on it song or,
19:27:14,0:11:55,student,That would make fungus a cannibal.,water.,
19:27:14,0:11:55,teacher,It would make them a cannibal?,Yes.,
19:27:30,0:12:11,student,"Well, I thought mushrooms and fungus are not dead organisms usually.","Well, it looks",
19:27:34,0:12:15,teacher,"Yeah, I mean like, what are some examples that you’ve seen them growing on?",like.,
19:27:34,0:12:15,student,Decaying wood,"This is what it was way,",
19:27:34,0:12:15,teacher,On decaying wood. Anywhere else?,my stuff.,
19:27:37,0:12:18,student,"Uh, on old food. Like, wet, wet, old clammy places. Like, one time I took a bunch of sand and, uh, dirt and water and everything and then put it in an airtight container, and in like two days mold started to grow.","So that's probably why I'm saying it's like my bread, it wouldn't work at all even seen it, just not as much eventually my ground",
19:27:51,0:12:32,teacher,"Yeah, how did it get there?","game Water,",
19:27:54,0:12:35,student,"I think it’s like because of the climate, and I think it’s like, I think it’s, being like carried, like carried along, and then it like, kinda like emerges, like grows",water from the arrow.,
19:27:56,0:12:37,teacher,"Would you say like, well, but how come it wasn’t growing when you first obtained it?",So it takes time for me to grow. Yeah.,
19:27:59,0:12:40,student,"Because it’s not, uh, it’s maybe because they didn’t like that habitat so they stay hidden.",Why Why does it take so much time,
19:28:07,0:12:48,teacher,"So what are some things that maybe all, all fungi need in order to like emerge?",to gather a group to do this with.,
19:28:10,0:12:51,student,Like wetness,"In what way they're like, what do you mean. So when you're looking at this thing that gets bigger and bigger and bigger Are you saying is, is that reproducing or is it growing, growing or.",
19:28:23,0:13:04,teacher,"Wet stuff, ok",What do,
19:28:27,0:13:08,student,"And it’s usually dark, they’re usually in dark places.",you say reproducing So when you're looking at all these different types of fun guy to.,
19:28:31,0:13:12,teacher,"Where did you keep them, when you-?",Are they all like we producing in the same way.,
19:28:42,0:13:23,student,"Uh, I kept them on my windowsill, but there’s like a bunch of trees blocking the windowsill so not a lot of light comes through","Because like some of the machines are connected, and they're all connected great and you see that and then any of the other kind of fun guy here. This one here.",
19:28:57,0:13:38,teacher,Ok,to look at this picture.,
19:29:00,0:13:41,student,Some like dark areas and cold areas similar to ...,Any other similar to like how they're,
19:29:05,0:13:46,student,"Like, because, in the forest there’s usually not much light and uh, I went with my family where, for edible mushrooms and they like all grow in the dark shadows.",the brightest kind of dry,
19:29:11,0:13:52,teacher,"Why would they grow in those kinds of areas, you think?",good observation that.,
19:29:22,0:14:03,student,It’s their natural habitat?,observations.,
19:29:53,0:14:34,student,There’s a lot of ...,Let's hear some ideas that you have.,
19:29:54,0:14:35,teacher,"when you think about plants, plants grow in certain areas, um, to survive, and get sunlight and whatnot. Um, why would fungi grow in like the dark woods are they getting anything from it?",What are some things that you've noticed that maybe are similar or different from,
19:30:16,0:14:57,student,Wetness. Water.,"Joe, they were, they had some fungus attached the trees and we don't.",
19:30:15,0:14:56,student,Food that they need to survive.,"You say, this",
19:30:21,0:15:02,teacher,"Um, sure. When you- You guys talked about a lot of good stuff. As you’re, um, going back through this maybe you can add some of those ideas you just talked about.","that the test attaches to things like cheese, and we don't",
19:30:33,0:15:14,student,Ew,want to add to that idea or shut up.,
19:30:40,0:15:21,teacher,Pull them out,Oh they need a host to grow on.,
19:30:47,0:15:28,student,They’re still wet,"Um, so let's go back to the ideas vitally needed folks with the host a sort of like, I can give me any well.",
19:31:00,0:15:41,teacher,You can even kinda touch them,"We saw the kind of the rat video where the rat flu season, throws it inside of it.",
19:31:07,0:15:48,student,It’s soggy. Yeah see- like wetness,"It could actually funded Verizon it that could be a source of food like we can bars and cereal, but that can be a nutrient and it's, it's just like how plants have, how they need water sun and air to create the sugar with",
19:31:31,0:16:12,student,"I like it, put water",some fun guy using the growing up and things for their food.,
19:31:37,0:16:18,teacher,"How is this, uh, how is this like the, the fruit that you just saw?",They might grow on other things to perfection. Oh for protection.,
19:31:42,0:16:23,student,"Well it’s like it looks really old and it’s like, it’s wet. So I think it does have to have a wet climate because this is wet and like the fruit was wet, and I added water to that, my little, uh, stuff that I made, so that’s probably why-","You know, can you maybe give us an example.",
19:31:46,0:16:27,teacher,"So you’re saying that if I used like dry bread it wouldn’t at all, you wouldn’t see any mold?","I'm like, some animal might like to Eat That Frog it.",
19:32:03,0:16:44,student,"No, it’s not that- just not as much",share show you. We move and talk and they just kind of stay in one place and kind of language that we know.,
19:32:13,0:16:54,student,Not as fast,Like they said they have the language that we don't know us making it happen.,
19:32:17,0:16:58,student,"Yeah, not as fast",Alright so they don't know.,
19:32:35,0:17:16,student,Because it would gain water eventually from ...,And as you,
19:32:35,0:17:16,student,"No, it would gain water from the air","can see that for quite a lot of us and running water, rather than they do is they create a partner when",
19:32:58,0:17:39,teacher,"Um, so it takes time for mold to grow.",they go to the,
19:32:58,0:17:39,teacher,"Um, why? Why does it take so much time?","word library, what do they look like",
19:33:02,0:17:43,student,"Because it still has, it probably still has to, uh, um, break out the egg or reproduce or something like that.",saying that they have.,
19:33:04,0:17:45,teacher,"Reproduce. Ok. In what way though, like, what do you mean? So when you’re looking at this here you’re saying that as it gets bigger and bigger and bigger you’re saying that it’s reproducing or that it’s growing?",Let's talk about maybe they,
19:33:16,0:17:57,student,It could be growing or reproducing.,want to think of you as a project plan.,
19:33:16,0:17:57,teacher,What do you guys think?,Okay.,
19:33:18,0:17:59,student,I think it’s growing,So it just be a part of themselves that out and.,
19:33:25,0:18:06,teacher,"You think it’s growing. You’re saying reproducing, so when you’re looking at all these different types of fungi too, are they all, like, reproducing in the same way you think?","Let's go ahead and continue where we left off, yesterday we were talking about how to live life.",
19:33:43,0:18:24,student,"Kind of, because like some of the mushrooms are connected, in a way.",Like you said they don't,
19:33:52,0:18:33,teacher,"Oh, they’re all connected? Do you see that in any of the other kind of fungi here? What about this one here? Are they all like, maybe connected at some point? Or is that like one, like, one mushroom here and just ...?","have the water to stay hydrated, but they get their nutrients from like it up",
19:33:55,0:18:36,student,"Like trees that can, like, grow more of them because they’re on the same tree.","During this like around them stuff is almost everything has nutrients, so they get stuff from everything else around them. Yeah.",
19:34:01,0:18:42,teacher,"Well, look at, look through some more of these pictures here, any other similarities, like how there’s tons of mushroom here, are there some patterns that you see as well?",Anybody else want to add to that.,
19:34:04,0:18:45,student,Like here the bread is kind of dry and there’s not that much mold visible.,Yeah.,
19:34:07,0:18:48,teacher,"Oh, that’s a good, that’s a good observation.","Maybe they get food from the hosts that are going on, or.",
19:34:12,0:18:53,teacher,"Um, let’s hear some ideas that you have right now. What are some things that you notice that maybe are similar or different?",Yeah.,
19:34:15,0:18:56,teacher,Joe?,"So, All he was saying like some of the",
19:34:21,0:19:02,student,"Um, they have, well they have, some fungus are attached to trees and we don’t.",stuff around them.,
19:34:32,0:19:13,teacher,"Ok, great. They grow on different things. So I heard- what did you say?","nega Alice's within the breath. We saw that like, Greg got thinner. So we're thinking that the actor or the guy took out in the bread, and also was like solution or tools like sure most of you have",
19:34:51,0:19:32,student,"I said that, uh, fungus attaches to different things like trees and we don’t.",seen the kind of breaking down.,
19:35:04,0:19:45,teacher,Does anyone want to add to that idea or shoot off with a new idea?,breaking down.,
19:35:04,0:19:45,student,"Uh, well, they need a host to grow on.",Everybody has stayed way to live. So that's why.,
19:35:14,0:19:55,teacher,"Ok, I’ll add that on here.","Like, like, one of the conditions.",
19:35:26,0:20:07,student,And they need a brain.,fun.,
19:35:28,0:20:09,teacher,"So let's go back to that idea. Why do they need a host, what's a host?",Let's be eating it so if you're looking at like that picture of the orange buttons all over it.,
19:35:40,0:20:21,student,"Uh, sort of like, uh...",Is it just like growing on it because of moisture. Is it growing on it because it's doing something else What do you think about that.,
19:35:42,0:20:23,teacher,You can give me an example.,Think of it.,
19:35:50,0:20:31,student,"Well, we saw kind of the rat video, where the rat was eaten from the inside of it, and when fungus grows on it, that could be it's source of food.","On the orange branch manager. Okay, so it's, it just needs the moisture, that's on that it'll live on anything that's what's maybe.",
19:35:59,0:20:40,student,"Like we eat candy bars and cereal, but that could be its nutrience and its food it eats, just like how plants, how they need water, sun, and air to create the sugar that they make.","Yeah, I'm thinking that the bacteria and fungus is always there. It's just that really Microsoft that you can't see it, and if the food isn't new before it starts rotting.",
19:36:10,0:20:51,teacher,So fungi grow on things for their food.,That's when the bacteria in the middle start feeding off of it. and that's when it grows to the receipt.,
,,student,They might grow on other things for protection.,,
19:36:18,0:20:59,teacher,"Oh, for protection, too. Could you maybe give us an example?",Okay so food has to get run first before you see mold growing on it. And do you agree with that food has to get brought in first and foremost was I or food is rotten because more grows on it.,
19:36:30,0:21:11,student,"Like, some animals might like to eat that fungus and maybe it would be harder to find it on the tree or whatever it's on.",Which coming up with the first statement Raise your hands,
,,teacher,You think the thing might have some kind of predator or something that might want to eat it?,,
19:36:36,0:21:17,student,"Yeah, maybe.",up with the second statement.,
19:36:37,0:21:18,teacher,"Any other ideas, off of that one?",So what's going on there then.,
19:36:52,0:21:33,student,"Um, we move and talk and they just kind of stay in one place and don't have a language that we know of.",Is that,
19:36:52,0:21:33,teacher,"I like what you said, they have a language we don't know of, so maybe they have a language.",what,
19:36:50,0:21:31,teacher,"Alright so, they don't move.",they claim they get,
19:37:08,0:21:49,teacher,Rebecca.,One guy saying that the other similar to the magazine.,
19:37:12,0:21:53,student,They use runners to grow.,"Wait. Currently,",
19:37:16,0:21:57,teacher,Can you say that a little louder?,so they the maggot eat the death thing and then it'll create a fungus.,
19:37:25,0:22:06,student,Runners.,Makes me Help me out.,
19:37:27,0:22:08,teacher,Water?,I don't think that they eat the food went out like a freight train they suck out all the water because water mostly makes up like a fruit snaps.,
19:37:37,0:22:18,student,Runners.,And so it Cheryl's,
19:37:45,0:22:26,teacher,What are those?,"getting out and also. Whenever I see, like, it seems like it has a bunch of moisture on it.",
19:37:58,0:22:39,student,"What they do is recreate a part of themselves, they grow on other trees and use things called ""runners.""","Okay. Oh, you mean like in a bag.",
19:38:03,0:22:44,teacher,"What are runners, what do they look like? Have you seen them before?","So we see going on across the water, please.",
19:38:16,0:22:57,teacher,"So you're saying they have...let's talk about the mold, so you're saying theres' runners?",Let's talk about this a little bit more growing on stuff that you bought.,
19:38:22,0:23:03,student,They can replant themselves.,"Do you think that getting anything out of them, like rotten food would you eat run.",
19:38:32,0:23:13,teacher,So it would just be a part of themselves that keeps growing and branching outward?,"Do you think most of the way things would want to eat rotten food. No, no. So what is what is rotten food was that me want to save Roger.",
19:38:36,0:23:17,student,Yeah.,"Yes. how I expired. And like it's not good for you to be sick. Okay, but what why is it not good for you to eat though.",
19:38:49,0:23:30,teacher,Sounds good.,All that all to,
19:38:58,0:23:39,teacher,Let's go ahead and continue where we left off yesterday.,make changes.,
19:38:58,0:23:39,teacher,We were talking about how fungi are like and unlike plants.,"Okay. Yeah, well I",
19:39:05,0:23:46,student,"You said they don't need photosynthesis, I'm thinking they just have the water to stay hydrated but they get their nutrience from like, maybe the dirty stuff that's around them, cause almost everything has nutrience.","guess you can closing. So maybe the nutrients, any, are like the freshness and then providing you to change or like turning bad.",
19:39:20,0:24:01,teacher,So they get stuff from everything that's around them?,"Taking the stuff and then turning into the nutrients that used to be good for you now are like, since it's rotten basically the goodness is gone, so it's just not",
19:39:36,0:24:17,teacher,Anyone want to add to that?,"saying that the goodness, what is good",
19:39:44,0:24:25,teacher,Alex?,for you.,
19:39:45,0:24:26,student,Maybe they get food from the host they're growing on?,"Like the vitamins and everything environments and what are you saying that Sunday, start off on fresh stuff, and then they break that down I take all the goodness the way, that way you say, I'm trying to see if I'm getting the credit union.",
19:39:58,0:24:39,teacher,"For food, so, and then, Ollie was saying some of the rotten stuff around them.",Yeah.,
19:40:00,0:24:41,teacher,Anika?,"I'm trying to see if I'm getting the credit union. Yeah. Yeah, we want to add to that, maybe I'm thinking differently from what.",
19:40:10,0:24:51,student,"I agree with Alex, with the bread, we saw that the bread got thinner, so we're thinking that the bacteria, or the fungi took out of the bread. And also with fruits and vegetables it like shrivels the food up.","Yeah, I don't think we started out on fresh stuff because",
19:40:11,0:24:52,teacher,"So you're saying they kind of break things, break that down like in a stomach? Yeah, Patrick?","I think when it starts to go bad. The, because",
19:40:19,0:25:00,student,"Maybe it has to stay wet to live, so that's why it doesn't live in lighted places, so like it doesn't dry up or something.",I think they're attracted to this.,
19:40:26,0:25:07,teacher,So it's one of the conditions. Okay.,"I don't know. You don't decide, like a refreshing bread and then the next day comics shows on it. It's like maybe after two weeks.",
19:40:34,0:25:15,teacher,"Yeah, James?",Where did it come from that fungus get like on things that you feel completely any of us.,
19:40:47,0:25:28,student,"Well they probably eat the host, because if the size decreases, it might be the fungus eating it.","Yeah, then there were like what parts of them they just like float in the air so you're saying we've got loads all around us right now.",
19:40:56,0:25:37,teacher,"It must be eating it. So if you're looking at the picture of the orange with fungus all over it, is it growing on it because of moisture? Is it growing on it because it's doing something else? What do you guys think about that?","Or maybe like people, inhale them.",
19:41:01,0:25:42,teacher,"Yeah, Kevin?",maybe.,
19:41:22,0:26:03,student,"Well, first of all, maybe the orange is in a dark place, and that in turn helps the orange to grow.","Yeah, I think, if you touch it.",
19:41:21,0:26:02,teacher,"Okay, so it just needs the moisture that's on there, it'll live on anything that's moist, maybe?",Actually I'm,
19:41:21,0:26:02,student,"I'm thinking that the bacteria and fungus is always there, it's just microscopic so you can't see it, and if the food isn't eaten before it starts rotting, that's when the bacteria and the mold start feeding off of it and that's when it grows so we can see it.",actually alive while it starts to add up.,
19:41:26,0:26:07,teacher,"Okay, so food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it. How many of you agree with that, food has to get rotten first before mold grows on it, or, food is rotten because mold grows on it. How many of you agree with the first statement? Raise your hands.","Okay, so once we, we'd like to have a different type of, let's say you got fungus on your hand or fungus in the air, and then it gets onto something, if it's so microscopic then how does it how does that we can see it.",
19:41:37,0:26:18,teacher,How many of you agree with the second statement?,We've got like the strawberries that high world all over the blackberries that are going on all around it.,
19:41:49,0:26:30,teacher,So what's going on there then?,"Isn't it microscopic though, how's it getting yk you think you might be fine. What do you mean by that can you like yourselves keep constantly dividing it there's no, not one sounds like a million each one from morning to go.",
19:41:59,0:26:40,student,"Maybe when maggots eat it, maybe like, when the maggots, their waste creates a mold, or a fungi? When there's mold there's fungi?",Okay.,
19:42:03,0:26:44,teacher,So you're saying that the fungi are similar to the maggots that eat the...?,Sounds like such a human a question so explaining and multiplying. No.,
19:42:23,0:27:04,student,"Or maybe the waste creates the fungi, as it eats it.","Since there's like lots and lots of bacteria like billions in this like cubic centimeter, like they can't just be one to reproduce, all of that I've been, like, since it's getting all those nutrients from the route, since it's been really healthy and",
19:42:50,0:27:31,teacher,So the maggots eat the dead thing and it will create a fungus?,"it starts reproducing and all of them that's why it grows so much as you can see it, saying there's a bunch of different types of plants that are growing, or it's just one individual that keeps growing.",
19:42:55,0:27:36,student,"I don't know, yeah.","success ideas here, as they brought other things of hope, and they, it says so many ways because I hope breaks things down.",
19:43:04,0:27:45,teacher,Maybe someone help me out. Ben?,"I might break it down, or how might it be similar to like, how we break down things, we eat we break down into any similarity Thank you can think of,",
19:43:20,0:28:01,student,"I don't think that they really eat the food, I think they suck out all the water, cause water mostly makes up a fruit's mass, so if it shrivels and loses most of its mass, that must mean that the water's getting out. And also, whenever I see fungi, it seems like it has a bunch of moisture around it, I'm wondering if it's because its water inside it is evaporated.","like, our stomachs have like acid separate.",
19:43:26,0:28:07,teacher,"Okay, you mean like if it's in a bag, and it has moisture in it?","So maybe like this year, or maybe even",
19:43:35,0:28:16,teacher,So we see it growing on places with water. And it needs moisture to grow.,when Ben said when he proposes it gets more of those nutrients like more nutrients come out.,
19:43:44,0:28:25,teacher,"Let's talk about this idea more. If they're growing on places you thought, do you think they're getting anything out of that at all?",So what he that he better at writing groups that have fresh fruit,
19:43:52,0:28:33,teacher,Like rotten food. Would you eat rotten food? Do you think most living things would want to eat rotten food?,"up to bat, or I'm pretty sure one stuff decomposes, the new chancellor leaving the mall whatever it is decomposition, and going into the soil or whatever, just like that's why we have compost, so like compost in what way to help make.",
19:44:21,0:29:02,student,No.,Maybe like Costco.,
19:44:27,0:29:08,teacher,"So what is rotten food? What does that mean when we say it's ""rotten""?","So, I think",
19:44:31,0:29:12,student,"It's kinda like expired, and like it's not good for you to eat because it makes you sick.",the matrix for us to start writing and then transcribing things like the garden and,
19:44:39,0:29:20,teacher,"Okay, but why is it not good for you to eat, though?","inserting stuff, you put like banana peels and got into a conversation, it turns into dirt, this has tons of nutrients.",
19:44:51,0:29:32,student,"But not all rotten is bad for you to eat, 'cause all cheese is rotten, because they make cheese with rotten milk, so not all rotten things are bad.",And it's really good for,
19:45:07,0:29:48,student,"Maybe it's decomposing, so maybe the nutrience in it, like the freshness and the combining nutrience are like turning bad?","great so that, maybe it's like compost in it provides things for other things like your condition.",
19:45:14,0:29:55,teacher,They're taking the stuff and turning it into...say that one more time.,"So we have a great start here with that so many ideas that is that it really makes a move on kind of are different from one another, or contradict one another but we're going to start trying to figure out how these kind of connect to one another, maybe",
,,student,"The nutrience that used to be good for you, now are like, since it's rotten basically, the goodness is gone, so it's just nothing, it makes you sick.",,
19:45:30,0:30:11,teacher,"So you're saying...the ""goodness"", what is goodness?","figure out what, how do you best, or one guy compose How do they move do they do they grow in most places Why do they use some of these things through to talk about that more throughout the unit.",
19:45:41,0:30:22,student,It's the stuff like the nutrience that's good for you.,What questions do you have that maybe we can try to answer as we go along well. This should his homework actually made me think of a couple of questions what questions you have about one guy,
19:45:53,0:30:34,teacher,Like what?,"events, can they rock still living thing. And they brought through like Rob still living thing. Okay.",
19:46:05,0:30:46,student,Like the vitamins and everything?,Not even like a kind of a bird in the living thing,
19:46:16,0:30:57,teacher,"Like vitamins and what not. Okay so you're saying that fungi start off on fresh stuff, and then they break stuff down and take all the goodness away, is that what you're saying?","is like,",
19:46:16,0:30:57,teacher,I'm trying to see if I'm getting the right idea down.,if we eat a rotting group is a fun guy with makes us sick.,
19:46:30,0:31:11,student,Yeah.,Other questions about how to fund guy.,
19:46:38,0:31:19,teacher,Anyone want to add to that? Maybe I'm thinking differently to what Ollie is saying.,Alex.,
19:46:44,0:31:25,student,"I don't think they start out on fresh stuff, because I think when it starts to go bad, they form on it because I think they're attracted to food that goes bad. Cause, I dont' know, you dont' just buy a really fresh loaf of bread and then the next day fungus grows on it. It's like maybe after 2 weeks you see fungus growing on it.",Why did you make that terrible smell. We all make that smell.,
19:46:56,0:31:37,teacher,Where did it come from then? How did fungus get on things you seal completely? Any ideas?,Have you can hardly reproduce,
19:47:09,0:31:50,teacher,"Yeah, Ben?",the audio recorder.,
19:47:12,0:31:53,student,They probably travel through air or touch.,How many questions.,
19:47:25,0:32:06,teacher,"Like what parts of them, they just like float through the air, so you're saying we've got fungus all around us right now, you think?",How does it acquire nutrience.,
19:47:40,0:32:21,student,"Well, I don't know, maybe people inhale them and breathe them out?",How does it acquire nutrience.,
19:48:01,0:32:42,teacher,Travel through air.,Like survival kit is.,
19:48:19,0:33:00,teacher,"Yeah, Grace.",going to want to have a question for as well.,
19:48:26,0:33:07,student,"I think if you... when you touch it, and there's fungus or bacteria on your hands, then after a while it starts to add up.",We're going to talk about today we're going to kind of talk about maybe some of the rules like do they decompose.,
19:48:37,0:33:18,teacher,"Okay, so once we like touch a type of... let's say you've got fungus on your hand or fungus is in the air, and it gets onto something, if it's so microscopic then how is it we can see it? We've got like the strawberries that had mold all over, the blackberries that are growing mold all around it, isn't it microscopic, though? how's it getting, why can we see it?","How are they affecting some places, are they growing everywhere?",
19:48:41,0:33:22,teacher,"Yeah, Ian, what do you think?","So we're gonna be talking about some of those things today. So let's add 42, or 43, to our turn off.",
,,student,Like binary fission?,,
,,teacher,"Binary, what do you mean by that? Can you tell me what that is?",,
,,student,"Like cells keep constantly dividing, so it's not one cell, it's like a million cells each one from one original?",,
,,teacher,"Okay, so you're saying bacteria do binary fission, so are you saying they are multiplying?",,
,,teacher,"Yeah, Ollie.",,
,,student,"Since there's like lots and lots of bacteria like billions in this cubic centimeter there can't just be one to reproduce all of that. I bet like, since it's getting all its nutrience from the fruit, since it's being really healthy and all, it starts reproducing all of them, that's why it grows so much that we can see it.",,
,,teacher,So you're saying there's a bunch of different types of fungus that's growing? Or it's just one individual that keeps growing?,,
,,student,It's lots of types.,,
,,teacher,"Let's go back to this idea of, they grow on other things as a host, and it breaks things down. How might it break it down? Or how might it be similar to how we break things down? Any similarities you can think of?",,
,,teacher,Patrick?,,
,,student,"Well like, our stomachs have acids that break things down, so maybe like the acids break things down?",,
,,teacher,They use acids.,,
,,student,"But when Ben said when a fruit breaks things down it decomposes, so more nutrience comes out, so wouldn't it be better to eat rotten fruit than fresh fruit?",,
,,teacher,"Hmm, good question. Alex do you have an answer?",,
,,student,"I'm pretty sure that when something decomposes, the nutrience are leaving whatever is decomposing is going into the soil or whatever, so that's why we have composts.",,
,,teacher,Like composts in what way?,,
,,student,To help make...hmm.,,
,,teacher,"So that's something we can think about, so part of adding nutrience is maybe like composts?",,
,,teacher,Claire?,,
,,student,"I think the nutrience for us is when it's not rotting and the nutrience for other things like gardens and stuff is when it is rotting, cause if you put like banana peels and things like that into a compost bin, it turns into dirt and has tons of nutrience and it's really good for growing things, so um, fungi could also help break down things like that. It does have nutrience for other things.",,
,,teacher,"Great, so maybe it's like compost and it provides things for other things, like dirt for nutrience?",,
,,teacher,"So we have a great start here. We've got so many ideas up here that are really great. Some of them kind of are different from one another or contradict one another, but we're going to start trying to figure out how these kind of connec tto one another, maybe figure out how do fungi decompose, how do they move, do they move at all? Do they grow in moist places? Why do they do some of these things? So we're gonna talk about that more during this unit. What questions do you have that maybe we can try to answer as we go along as well? Yesterday's homework I actually made you think of a couple questions, what questions do you have about fungi?",,
,,teacher,"Yeah, Ben?",,
,,student,Can they rot still living things?,,
,,teacher,Can they rot food?,,
,,student,"Like, rot still living things?",,
,,teacher,"Oh, okay",,
,,teacher,You're using rot like a verb? Can they rot living things.,,
,,teacher,Any other questions?,,
,,teacher,Ollie.,,
,,student,"If we eat a rotting fruit, is the fungi what makes us sick?",,
,,teacher,"Any other questions you have, yeah, Amy?",,
,,student,How do fungi eat?,,
,,teacher,How DO fungi eat?,,
,,student,Why do fungi make that terrible smell?,,
,,teacher,Do they all make that smell? Good question.,,
,,student,How do they reproduce?,,
,,teacher,How do they reproduce.,,
,,teacher,"Um, Yadi.",,
,,student,How many parts do they have?,,
,,teacher,How many parts do they have.,,
,,teacher,That's real good.,,
,,teacher,"Um, Roxton and then Patrick.",,
,,student,Is mushroom a fungi?,,
,,teacher,Patrick?,,
,,student,How does fungi acquire nutrience?,,
,,teacher,How does it acquire nutrience.,,
,,teacher,Any others?,,
,,teacher,Kevin?,,
,,student,"Well, can it survive if it's like extreme heat?",,
,,teacher,Any other questions?,,
,,teacher,"As we're going along, too, we'll add questions if we have more. This is a great place to start off.",,
