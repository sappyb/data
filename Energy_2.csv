,T,"So, if I take this here, and I add it to this glass, how much do you think we're going to have?",T,,
,S,Seventy percent,F,,
,T,"So, some people are saying we'll have the same amount we started with, some people say we're going to have more than we started with. So I want to hear from the people who said we're going to have the same amount first. Why would we have the same amount that we started with?",F,,
,S,Just threw that out there,F,,
,T,"Ok, so a guess. Anyone have a reason and not just a guess? Alisha?",F,,
,S,Because the tube is connected from that glass to that glass so there would have to be the same amount.,F,,
,T,So you're saying that the connection between the two flasks means that nothing could ever get out? That's why you're saying it's the same amount? It's going from one to the other?,F,,
,S,,,,
,T,"Ok. Anyone want to argue for the more? Why we have more than we started with? And David, are you willing to tell everyone why you think there would actually be less? Do you have a reason?",T,,
,S,"I said there's less because not all of the Coke is gone, there's some left.",F,,
,T,So explain your thinking a little more. You're saying there's some left in here?,F,,
,S,"It's transferring to the second bottle, but it didn't all get there because there is some left in the first.",F,,
,T,"So, if I recombine it, shouldn't it be the same amount? Or not?",F,,
,S,I guess.,F,,
,T,"Well, what do you think? Why wouldn't it be the same amount? Where would it have gone?",F,,
,S,Because some of it is air.,F,,
,T,How is it air? We got it all closed up.,F,,
,S,It popped off.,F,,
,T,"Oh, it popped off. Ok. You got your hand up.",F,,
,S,I think it's going to be less.,F,,
,T,You think it's going to be less. Any reason?,F,,
,S,,,,
,T,"Alright, let's see what happens. So where's 75 on there? This is 75. So we have just over 50 milliliters. So we have less. Ok? So now we know what the answer is. We have less. So why do we have less? I have heard from people that it should be the same because all that happened is something moved from one flask to the other one. But then Alano said that's not what happened because I saw it pop off and it went into the air. How did it go into the air?",T,,
,S,"The soda was evaporating and then went on to the other one, and so when it popped up it threw away most of the evaporated stuff going through the tube, and that made it like condense.",F,,
,T,"Ok, this is the second time, Raul, that I heard you use the word throw to describe how the steam is moving, or how the gas is moving. You said it got thrown away.",F,,
,S,"It shot out, with the gas.",F,,
,T,"So, you're talking about the suddeness of it?",F,,
,S,"You know how the tube, it popped up? Then the steam just shot away, and then you have less.",F,,
,T,"So, there's something going on with the steam and everything that's happening here? Alright. So I want you to look up at our learning target: I will be able to record and share my ideas. Right now, if you look at your paper, you should be able to say, yes I have recorded all my ideas. All those spaces should be filled. There should be zoom-ins and drawings.",F,,
