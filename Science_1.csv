,T,"okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ",FALSE,statement+confirmation,,
,T,"because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. ",TRUE,statement,recall,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
,T,and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. ,TRUE,statement,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,

,T,"in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ",FALSE,question,reframe,
,S,a chain? ,FALSE,,,
,T,anybody? ,TRUE,,,
,T,what is a monomer,FALSE,Question,content,
,T,"uh, aimee",FALSE,,,
,S,are they simple molecules? ,FALSE,,,
,T,"yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ",FALSE,Question,check understanding,
,S,a polymer. ,FALSE,,,
,T,bingo! ,FALSE,,,
,T,so mono means what,TRUE,Question,Content,
,S,one. ,FALSE,,,

,T,"mono ... okay, polymers are molecules joined together. ",FALSE,Statement,confirm,
,T,"and they're joined together, how are they joined together",FALSE,Question,check understanding,
,T,I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ,FALSE,Question,reframe,
,S,".., I don't know, like, they're just around each other. ",FALSE,,,
,T,they're around one another and they're linked together. ,FALSE,Statement,confirm,
,T,"what are they linked together in, samantha",TRUE,Question,content,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
,T,but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ,TRUE,Question,scenario,
,S,a chain? ,FALSE,,,
,T,bingo! ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"thank you, a chain",FALSE,Statement,confirm,
1,T,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,"but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ",TRUE,Statement,recall,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,anything else you want to add to this,FALSE,Question,recall,
1,S,“mer” means molecules? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, we can write this",TRUE,Statement,confirm,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ",TRUE,Statement,confirm,

1,T,samantha,TRUE,,,
1,S,they can be all scrunched together? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,okay. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,up and down and side to side. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. ,FALSE,Statement,set up task,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains ... can kinda be arranged two different ways. ,TRUE,Statement,recall,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. ",FALSE,Statement,recall,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,and then how's the other one,FALSE,Question,content,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,do you remember,FALSE,Question,recall,
1,S,scrunched together. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,scrunched together kinda like? ,FALSE,Question,clarify,
1,S,crisscross? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,kinda like crisscrossed. ,FALSE,Statement,confirm,
1,T,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. ,FALSE,Statement,set up task,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ",TRUE,Question,confirm,

1,T,how were the chains arranged,FALSE,Question,recall,
1,T,dave? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ,FALSE,Question,choose,
1,S,parallel. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ,FALSE,Question,dig deeper,
1,S,rip it easy. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"you could rip it very, very easily. ",FALSE,Statement,confirm,
1,T,"okay, what was the other thing that we used in class",TRUE,Question,recall,

1,S,made it hard to tear. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"made it very, very hard to tear. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac ... actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ,FALSE,Question,dig deeper,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,okay,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, I'm going to go over here on the overhead, guys; I'm not gonna turn the lights off because I'm not gonna be up here for very long, okay? ",TRUE,,,
1,T,"kind of a r ... kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. ",TRUE,Statement,set up task,
1,T,okay. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,this is “monomers”. ,TRUE,,,
1,T,you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period,TRUE,Question,recall,
1,T,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,"this is actually polystyrene, which is up here; it's a plastic container. ",TRUE,,,
1,T,"and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the ... of the chemical names of the polymers? ",TRUE,Question,analyze,
1,S,poly. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. ",FALSE,Statement,tip,
1,T,"that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ",TRUE,Question,content,
1,S,polymer. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,a polymer. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,a polymer. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, good",FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today",TRUE,Statement,set up task,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"the arrangement of chains can influence the behavior of the polymers, whose properties are different from the original elements. ",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"here you have a whole bunch of elements, you put them together and you've created something brand new. ",TRUE,,,
1,T,okay. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,and how they were arranged in the tyvek. ,TRUE,Question,recall,
1,S,can we draw it? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,you may draw it. absolutely.,FALSE,,,
1,T,what ... how did that newspaper behave? ,TRUE,Question,recall,

,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,questions,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,questions,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,okay,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,excellent,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,all righty,FALSE,,,
1,T,This is investigating polymers activity part one. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. ",FALSE,Statement,set up task,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,okay. all righty. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"the first polymer ... jim, you want to share something",TRUE,,,
1,S,"uh, no. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,okay. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,it's this one right up in here. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,it's called plumber's tape,TRUE,,,
1,T,I don't know if you guys can see it from here,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"if you go into home depot and you say, “i need plumber's tape” they know exactly what you're talking about. ",FALSE,Statement,experience,(drawing on everyday knowledge)
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"but if you go into home depot and say, “i need poly tetra fluoro ethylene” they may not know what you're talking about. ",FALSE,Statement,experience,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,here you've got the “poly” which means the many. ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,does anybody here know what tetra means,FALSE,Question,content,
1,S,“tetra” means a number. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,yeah. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,"it means, like ... hold on, no, I thought ..",FALSE,,,
1,T,anybody here know what “tetra” means? ,TRUE,Question,content,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, tetra is a number",FALSE,Statement,direct explanation,
1,T,"usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"fluoro is probably fluorine off of the, uh, element table and then ethylene is also another couple of different elements off of the periodic table. ",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ,TRUE,Question,experience,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,do you guys know what I'm talking about,FALSE,,,
1,S,duct tape? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"this stuff. not duct tape, plumber's tape",FALSE,,,
1,S,oh.,FALSE,,,
1,T,that's plumber's tape in here. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape",TRUE,Request,experience,
1,S,"yeah, its not sticky but it's like ... it's when you wrap it, it squeezes really tight around things, it's like teflon tape. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,you can fix gas leaks with it. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,that's what I used it for,FALSE,,,
1,T,okay. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,"and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too",FALSE,,,
1,T,"as a matter of fact, yeah, also known as teflon, so you're correct in that assumption. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,"yes, charlotte",TRUE,,,
1,S,I wrapped it around my finger and it turned my finger all purple. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"well, yeah I think so. if you wrap anything around your finger it's gonna turn your finger all purple",FALSE,,,
1,T,anybody else? does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ,TRUE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"and I kinda dispersed it around that way you ... people around you can take a look at it, too. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,nice and flat if you possibly can,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,let's see. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"jessica, i'll give you some",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, can everybody ... samantha, I'm going to give you some since you guys can take a look at that. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,what about over here on this side of the room? ,TRUE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, jason, I'm gonna get you a piece, too, I think I have another piece up here. ",TRUE,,,
1,T,"okay, yeah",FALSE,,,
1,S,you can't touch it? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"yes, you can. ",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,you just leave it flat. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too",FALSE,Request,observe,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"and actually they'll make another type, this is more for, pipes and there is another one that's a little bit more flimsier. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,"that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ",TRUE,,,
1,S,how does it stick under the pipe? ,FALSE,Student question,content,
1,T,"actually, it just does it by, whe ... eh, you're gonna figure that out. ",FALSE,Statement,set up task,
1,S,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,"I'm not gonna tell you, you're gonna figure that one out",FALSE,,,
1,S,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,"see whether or not your ink pen or pencil, whatever that you're using on it right now, that you can write your initials on it. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,see if you can do that. with the plumber's tape,FALSE,,,
1,T,"if you guys want to feel it, who doesn't have any, you guys can actually see what that feels like. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,it's kinda really smooth; it kinda feels good. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,mine won't work. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,huh? ,FALSE,,,
1,S,it ripped through. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,me too. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"that's okay, it ripped through? ",FALSE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay then maybe you don't want to go in too deep, then",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,oh good,TRUE,,,
1,S,miss? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,cool. ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, good",FALSE,,,
1,T,"all right, ladies and gents, we know this is a polymer because I told you that. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. ,TRUE,Statement,set up task,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways,TRUE,Statement,recall,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. ",TRUE,Statement,recall,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ,TRUE,Statement,set up task,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk ... everybody, jason, got it? ",TRUE,request,task,
1,S,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,"now, do you see the tape? ",TRUE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,you see the top part of the tape and you see the bottom part of the tape,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,top and the bottom part of the tape,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,I want you to ever so gently stretch it out. ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,just ever so gently stretch it out,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,from top to bottom,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,okay? ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"and, other people in the classroom, if you want to take a look at what they're doing, make sure they're doing it right",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. okay? ",FALSE,Statement,observe,
1,S,I didn't make a cute little ribbon. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,you didn't make a cute little ribbon? okay. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,it looks like yellow bacon. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"looks like yellow bacon, okay. ",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"so, that's something that I could do with this",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, can you guys see that?",TRUE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"all right. now, I stretched it this way. ",TRUE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"did that tell me anything about how the chains were, in the middle of the tape?",TRUE,Question,infer,
1,S,yeah. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ,FALSE,Question,reframe,"(or recall, but in this context, it seems to be referencing something that just happened)"
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"no you didn't, okay.",FALSE,,,
1,T,"now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,and tell me what happens. ,FALSE,Question,observe,
1,S,the chains... go back to normal,FALSE,,,
1,T,it goes back to normal. okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,(silent),TRUE,,,
1,T,"and if you want to have your other partners or somebody who didn't have a chance to do this, do this again",TRUE,,,"(checked up to here, 10/12/2021; remaining are auto generated by speaker)"
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,my name would be real distorted. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,but if I were to pull like this I would have my name nice nice and original again; normal again. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,what does this tell you? ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ,TRUE,Question,infer,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ,FALSE,Question,choose,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,based on what this can do,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,do you think they're parallel to one another or do you think that they're crisscrossed? ,FALSE,Question,choose,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,depending on what I can do with this,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,I see some hands going up. ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,some hands going up,FALSE,,,
1,T,jessica. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,parallel. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,they're parallel. And why do you think they're parallel?,FALSE,Question,dig deeper,
1,S,"because you can stretch it from side to side and it's kind of easy to do, and if it was crisscrossed it would be harder. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,yeah. I agree with that,FALSE,,,
1,T,"just by pulling it this way, its giving you an indication that the chains are parallel. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,if the chains were crisscrossed do you think we'd be able to get it back to its original way real quick? ,TRUE,Question,scenario,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"no, we don't",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,okay,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,how were the chains arranged? ,TRUE,Question,dig deeper,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,that the chains were arranged in that certain way? ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,then tell me what evidence did you see that gives you an indication that the chains were arranged parallel. ,FALSE,Question,reframe,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,".., well you really got yours stretched out, huh? ",TRUE,,,
1,S,.. I had ... I got carried away with it. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"you got carried away with it, so what do you think happened to your poor chains? ",FALSE,Question,infer,
1,S,I ripped it. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,yeah. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,"you ripped it, too. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,and I ripped it too. ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,this brings up a point. ,TRUE,,,
1,T,"jason's poor plumber's tape, he really got it really stretched out",TRUE,,,
1,S,but I supported my scientific thing. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,you ... okay. you took it one step further,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"what do you think happened to these poor polymer chains, from what jason did to them",TRUE,Question,infer,
1,S,they got broken.,FALSE,,,
1,T,what do you think happened? ,FALSE,,,
1,S,they got stretched too far so they ripped. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"yeah. stretched too far so they ripped, very good",FALSE,,,
1,S,or do they actually get more like ... do they all get thinner? ,FALSE,Student question,scenario,
1,T,they will actually stretch out and get thinner. ,FALSE,Statement,direct explanation,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"well, I shouldn't ... and sometimes that all depends, too",FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,okay? ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,all right,TRUE,,,
1,T,and I hope I'm going to be successful with it today. ,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,I was semi+successful with it yesterday,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,jim? ,TRUE,,,
1,S,"but still, if you got, like, your arm cut off or something, then all your polymer chains will be cut and everything? ",FALSE,Student question,scenario,
1,T,"oh, absolutely. ",TRUE,Statement,confirm,
1,S,oh. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,absolutely. ,TRUE,,,
1,S,"then how do you have polymer chains in your blood, dna, and everything? ",FALSE,Student question,dig deeper,
1,T,well that's because you got to consider all polymers as a gigantic molecule. ,FALSE,Statement,direct explanation,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,it's smaller molecules put together,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,and all they are just smaller molecules that are hooked up together. ,TRUE,,,
1,S,"so whenever, like, you find a piece of dna that's not like your entire dna string, it's just a little piece. ",FALSE,Student question,confirm,
1,T,no it's not. it's a little piece,TRUE,,,
1,S,"so is your entire dna string, like, going up and down through your body all the way? ",FALSE,Student question,confirm,
1,T,"no. that big old gigantic molecule is really, really, coiled inside the nucleus. ",FALSE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,Statement,direct explanation,
1,T,"do you guys, do you remember that",FALSE,Question,recall,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,okay,FALSE,,,
1,T,"and, yeah, and you can actually stretch that molecule out its very, very long. ",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,but it's not all up and down your arm. ,FALSE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"it's compacted inside of every single cell inside of your body, that has a nucleus",FALSE,,,
1,S,how are polymers arranged inside the body? ,FALSE,Student question,content,
1,T,it all depends. all depends.,FALSE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"um, some could be arranged parallel, some could be arranged crisscross, some could be cross+linked together",FALSE,Statement,direct explanation,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"all depends on what they're what they're needed for, what they're used for. ",FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, any questions",TRUE,,,
1,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,any other questions,TRUE,,,

,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"uh, what I'm going to do I'm gonna take a skewer",TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,

1,T,where should I put the skewer? ,TRUE,Question,task,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,somebody in here tell me,TRUE,,,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,like we did with the plumber's tape we stretched it different ways to see whether or not we could figure out how the chains are going. ,TRUE,Question,elaborate,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"uh, same thing with the balloon. ",TRUE,Statement,elaborate,
,S,(silent),FALSE,,,
1,T,"jim, what do you think",TRUE,,,

1,S,no. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,no? ,TRUE,,,
1,S,"cause it's stretched out inside there on the top, but down where the bottom is it's not blown up all the way, so it's thicker on the bottom. ",FALSE,,,

1,S,bigger. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,and thinner,FALSE,,,
1,S,it was maybe a lot bigger and thinner. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,what happened to you after you heated it,FALSE,,,
1,S,it shrunk and got really thick and not as flexible. ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"yeah, it just kinda shrunk, but it got thicker. ",FALSE,,,

,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, it says ""plus""",TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,"well, you know that we talked about polymer chains being arranged two different ways, remember that? ",TRUE,,,
1,S,"parallel and crisscrossed, remember? ",FALSE,,,
1,S,how did the arrangement ... so how do you think the chains are arranged in a plastic,FALSE,,,
1,T,"um, I think parallel, because you see the ... ",TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, then how do the arrangement of the chains influence the behavior of the plastic container? ",TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,in other words the chains were arranged in a certain way based on what you said. ,TRUE,,,
1,S,"when you heated it, how did that ... what did that to the plastic container? ",FALSE,,,
1,T,mm+hm. ,TRUE,,,
1,S,I know. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,mm+hm. ,FALSE,,,
1,S,that's right,FALSE,,,
1,S,"tell me, how do you know that",FALSE,,,
1,S,what did you observe happening in the toaster oven,FALSE,,,
1,T,it went up. ,TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,"mm, yeah. ",TRUE,,,
1,S,"okay, guys, jim you have a question? ",FALSE,,,
1,T,no. ,TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,"okay, bell is gonna be ringing in about two minutes. ",TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,let me share with you before the bell rings what I want you to do with these papers,TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,"if they're not done, finish them for homework, I see you again tomorrow. ",TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,because I have to tell you something at the end of the class period. ,TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,okay,TRUE,,,
1,S,yes? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,.. for the last time? ,TRUE,,,
1,S,"no, I didn't. ",FALSE,,,

1,S,how can they change? ,FALSE,,,
1,T,"uh, criss ... from parallel to crisscross. ",TRUE,,,
1,T,"they really can't change from a parallel to a crisscross, we'll talk about that, we'll talk about that next class period. ",TRUE,,,
1,S,"uh, let's see, samantha? ",FALSE,,,
1,T,they could become smaller when you heat them. ,TRUE,,,
1,S,when you heat them what can we do to those long polymer chains? ,FALSE,,,
1,S,we can,FALSE,,,
1,T,shrink them. ,TRUE,,,
1,S,"we can shrink them, yeah. ",FALSE,,,
1,S,"so polymer chains can expand, and polymer chains can",FALSE,,,
1,T,"but you know when they shrink, they get stronger? ",FALSE,,,
1,T,"yes, they do. ",TRUE,,,
,S,,FALSE,,,
1,T,good and we'll talk about that also next class period,TRUE,,,
1,S,good. ,FALSE,,,
