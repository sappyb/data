,[You]:,"Our purpose is to investigate how gasses behave and what factors affect their behavior. So we're going to look at a scenario of this tank car. You have this tank train, and the interior of the tank car was washed out and cleaned with steam, and all the outlet valves were shut and the tank car was sealed. All the workers went home for the evening and when they returned in the morning this is what they found- I mean, do you know what they found?",T,Giving explicit guidance,Motivating students,,Engage
,[Bot]:,It exploded.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Maybe it exploded. Does anyone else have an idea of maybe what they found when they came back?,F,Questioning and prompting,Getting Students' hypothesizing,,"Engage, explore"
,[Bot]:,It decompressed.,F,,,,
,[You]:,What? Decompressed?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Yeah. You can see where the stress is at. Or maybe it froze.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so maybe we had a phase change, some stuff froze inside of it. So we have the idea that maybe it exploded, maybe it compressed, and maybe we see a- what?",F,Giving explicit clarification,Summarizing ideas,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Steam.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Did you say steam? Maybe you saw some steam coming off of it.,F,Giving explicit clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Because they were washing with steam.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. So let's see what happened. Here's what they found when they came back.,T,Using instructional aids,,,Engage
,[Bot]:,Holy! Wow! Why'd that happen?,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So that's what we're going to try to figure out. So I have a video of it actually happening, too.",F,Using instructional aids,,,Engage
,[Bot]:,That's crazy.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. So here it is.,F,Using instructional aids,,,Engage
,[Bot]:,Whoa! That's crazy! Is it because there's nothing inside of it?,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So, pretty crazy event here. I hear many of you asking how does it happen, and I've heard you saying some ideas, so what I want you to do, in the notes section of your journal, take a few minutes to brainstorm. What do you think is happening? What was happening inside or outside that made it crush? Why did it crush? How did it crush? If it helps you might want to think about before and after and maybe draw a picture of it. Maybe what was happening inside, outside, before, and then after.",F,,Eliciting Students' Initial Ideas,,Engage
,,,,,,,
,[Bot]:,There was no space for the moisture to go so it just exploded,T,,,,
,[You]:,So why would it go in?,F,Questioning and prompting,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,What do you mean?,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Because the tank went like, it went in.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Oh, yeah. Ok.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Good thought process here.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,Evaluate
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,What do you think?,T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,No idea.,F,,,,
,[You]:,No Idea? Well take a guess. What's happening inside of that tanker when they steam cleaned it?,F,Questioning and prompting,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,No idea.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. Haha. So, is there anything inside there?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,No.,F,,,,
,[You]:,No? Steam?,F,Questioning and prompting,Identifying Gaps in Students' Knowledge,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"There's, like, ripples in there- I don't know, I don't know.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. You don't want to guess? You need to think about something- Try to take a guess. It doesn't have to be right at this point.,F,,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Alright.,F,,,,
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,What do you think's happening?,T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"I think the air would be sucked out of it, I think that’s what was happening to it.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"But it was sealed, right?",F,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Yeah, it was sealed.",F,,,,
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"So when the steam turned back toliquid, what happened?",T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Everything was being sucked in.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So, What happens when steam turns into liquid? So when we think of our flask, that it was in, what was happening when the steam got- when the water vapor came off of it? Where did it go?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Into the balloon.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So it made that balloon expand. So what happened- how did we make the balloon unexpand?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,We had to let it go. Like the pressure difference maybe.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. And what happens to the stuff, the water, the gas, what happens to it?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,They turn back to water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so maybe that has something to do with it? How would that have something to do with it?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,What's going on here?,T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"For now we're just thinking about before it crunches and we're taking notes, or whatever.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. Good.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,Evaluate
,[Bot]:,"But the whole thing is, about the tornado, it looked like a mini tornado inside the tank that causes it to crash in an instant.",F,,,,
,[You]:,But what causes this mini tornado inside?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"The steam, and then like, the air that we saw already in it.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,So it made like a little mini tornado.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so you have steam inside, and what do you know about steam and its movement?",F,Questioning and prompting,Activating Prior Knowledge,,Engage
,[Bot]:,It's rapid.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Yes, the molecules are moving rapidly, and then there's already some air in there, ok, maybe, and then we know it's closed, a closed valve. And so why do you think then it would crush after that, if you get this movement of molecules inside and air inside?",F,Questioning and prompting,Summarizing Ideas,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Because it likes to move around. Like tornados, they start in one spot, and eventually they move to another one before they die out. So maybe it like, was running out of space inside the tank, it was trying to get out, and maybe it got unsealed and it was like ""new air!"".",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh, well I think we can probably assume that the valve actually was sealed. Nothing was able to get in or out, it was a closed container. So let's go with that assumption, that there's not movement coming in and out of anything. So whatever's in here is in here. We need to think about how does the movement of the molecules inside end up, later, having that tanker crush. And one thing to think about is it was over night, so think about over night, what could have-",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"So we can add anything. Someone could have came and, you know…",F,,,,
,[You]:,"No, we want to still stay with the assumption that it was sealed, so nobody touched it, it was just there. But what happens ove night?",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Was it cold weather or like, hot weather?",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Um, let's just imagine it's was a day like today.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Ok. So then the air probably cooled off a little bit, maybe.",F,,,,
,[You]:,So do you know how hot it was this morning when you got up?,F,Questioning and prompting,Monitoring and Guiding Students' Discussions/Work,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Like fourty one degrees.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, and what is the high temperature for today?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,I didn't watch the news.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"It's supposed to get up to seventy today, so there is some temperature changes happening. Think about how maybe those temperature changes can affect what's happening in here.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,?
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"So let's start with the beginning here, what's happening?",T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Um, in the beginning steam expanded and the high pressure was-",F,,,,
,[You]:,So what's this high pressure? Where is the high pressure?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"You know how the experiement you did, when you put in the hot water and the balloon kind of blew up from all the steam?",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so can you show me that in this picture? What is the pressure doing?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,It's pushing out.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so let's illustrate that. It's pushing- so how is it pushing? Like, what's going on with those-",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"It's expanding, it's gettinng hot, it's got nowhere else to go.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,It's trying to escape.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So you might want to add that to your diagram. So you have pressure against the container wall, because why?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Because the gas is expanding. Because it's hot.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so then what happens- oh, so it's taking up more space- and then what do you see, what's happening in the middle here?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It's starting to go back to water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,It's not taking up as much space.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So you have some liquid here. And maybe, you know how you indicate some pressure here, maybe you can show that here. And what are these arrows?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,That's the pressure making contractions.,F,,,,
,[You]:,What pressure? The pressure of what?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Of the steam. Because it's- it has to contract because there's not enough heat.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so it's putting less pressure aginast the walls of the container?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,But how does that make the container end up like this? How does it crush?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Because it's the pressure on the outside is stronger than on the inside.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh, ok. Interesting idea. So there's pressure in the air, and now somehow that is now less than this?",F,"Providing feedback, Questioning and prompting",,,"?, Elaborate"
,[Bot]:,More.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh more than this, oh right. So maybe you can show that in this picture then.",F,,,,?
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,This looks empty now. Is it empty?,T,Questioning and prompting,Identifying Gaps in Students' Knowledge,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Well, I mean, maybe it has regular air in it.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Because this is before, they steam cleaned it, and so then they closed all the vales, and nothing could get in or out, so there still has to be something in there. What would be in here?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Just, some air. Regular air.",F,,,,
,[You]:,What happened to the steam?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It went out when it exploded. I mean imploded. Because it broke really quick and there's holes all over it. So the steam got out.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So let's assume that it didn't break, that it just crushed.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,So then the steam is still there.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So the steam is still there, so how can you explain what happened?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Maybe it turned into liquid.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Why would it turn into liquid?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"You said something about that, right?",F,,,,
,[You]:,"So, it went back to liquid, so how can you show that in your picture?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,We could just draw some water.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"And then I want you to think about why would, what's going on here, and it turns into liquid, why would it cause this crushing? Why would it crush in?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Because we learned about the heat, that it expands, so if it's cold- I don't know why I think it's cold. The heat could get out.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"It can't come out, it's sealed.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"I guess it went in reverse. Instead of first liquid and then gas, I guess it just reversed",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so you need to think about what would cause this to implode.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,If for some reason the molecules are getting smaller or changing size.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So what do they do?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,They're pulling in the sides of the tank.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Like, remember if I have some steam and I have some water, which takes up more space?",F,Questioning and prompting,Activating Prior Knowledge,,Engage?
,[Bot]:,"The water- no, the steam.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so think about that. You have steam here, you said it's going all quickly, what is that doing to the outside of the container?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,What do you mean?,F,,,,
,[You]:,"The molecules that are moving in here, how are they-",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,They're putting pressure.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So they're putting pressure against the container here?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,There's a lot of pressure in the container.,F,,,,
,[You]:,You might want to draw- show me how you would show pressure inside of the container. And then think about what causes this to shrink in. Ok? Think about that.,F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,So what do you mean by gravity?,T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Gravity. Like air pressing down on the tank.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so there's air pressing down on the tank. Is that only on the top, you think?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Well, it- we just think that there's more air on the top pushing down than in the bottom there's not a lot of air in the bottom.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so there's air pushing on the tank here.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"And then, tell me what's going on in this picture now.",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Um, it's starting to kinda get pushed in.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so what's causing that pushing?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Um, pressure on the tank, and maybe like the metal got a little weakned by the steam being so heated so that maybe made it more easier to press down.",F,,,,
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,For now let's assume that nothing could get in or out. So nothing can come out. What's happening inside to make it take up less space?,T,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,The molecules are breaking other molecules because they need some space because there's not much room inside.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, and then I want you to continue thinking about that and then think about that they went home and came back the next day, so think about what could have happened over night that could also affect what's inside",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"The molecules became like, this molecule went into this one and became bigger.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so maybe molecules combine and that's why they're taking up less space.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Um, so, but remember if molecules combine they become something else. So do you think what was inside the tanker changed?",F,Questioning and prompting,Facilitating Students to Revise Ideas,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Not really because they were just inside the tank.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so think about what happened over night that when they came back, they saw this. But I like seeing some of these things here, that's good. Keep it up, you're doing a good job.",F,"Giving Explicit Instruction, Providing feedback",,,Elaborate
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"So what do you mean by ""suck all the air""?",T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Like, you know, we had a little air in the tank, right here.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Where's the air?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Inside.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Inside? Is there air outside, too?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Gravity. Like, all the molecules sucked all the air in which made the molecules bigger.",F,,,,
,[You]:,How could air get in here?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Air molecules.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"But remember we said it was a sealed container, so nothing can get in or out.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"That's what I'm saying, the air inside.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Oh, so the air inside is getting- it's sucking somehow?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Yeah.,F,,,,
,[You]:,But what does that have to do with what you are calling gravity out here? The pressure.,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,It pushes down.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So that's still pushing here. I don't see it here. Um, but what's happening inside?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"Um, the molecules are not moving as rapidly as they were at first.",F,,,,
,[You]:,So how does that allow it to cause it to crush?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,There's more pressure.,F,,,,
,[You]:,No more pressure? Pressure where?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,On the tank. All over the tank.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,All the molecules were moving around. And so there's no more pressure.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. So can one of you write a note of that for yourself, so when you're presenting you remember to say that part?",F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"And we can have phase changes, and also there's liquids and gasses, and we also know that temperature affects it. So if we go over night, what you guys were already talking about, it can get colder.",T,Providing Feedback ,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Isn't it hard for gas to be contained?,F,,,,
,[You]:,Uh huh.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"There it is. The gas, like, didn’t want to be in there. The molecules pushed outwards somehow…",F,,,,
,[You]:,So maybe they're pushing out here. So why don't you show that?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"…the molecules bumped into each other too much so they went faster, pushing out more.",F,,,,
,[You]:,But that would cause an explosion. Right? And we're thinking of implosion.,F,Providing Feedback ,Facilitating Students to Revise Ideas,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"But only the middle collapsed, and the sides didn't really collapse.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so only the middle collapsed. So if you have like a water bottle or something, how do you get it to collapse?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Easy.,F,,,,
,[You]:,How?,F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"You just, like, take all the air out of it.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok. Or how else could you get it to collapse? I have a can in front of me, what can I do to make it crush?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,Stomp on it.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Yeah, you stomp on it. So what are you doing when you stomp on it?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Hulk angry!,F,,,,
,[You]:,"So, maybe there's something going on outside that's making it get smaller.",F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"Maybe there's an invisible foot, that like, basically stomped on it.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so let's take all these ideas. You told me you have molecules moving around, you also told me they're expanding and they're putting pressuring along the outside of the tank. So maybe you could draw some of those things. Something to show me that it's putting pressure against the walls of the container.",F,,Synthesizing Students' Explanations,,Explain
,,,,,,,
,[You]:,"It was 70 degrees in the middle of the day, and then maybe 30 degrees overnight. How could that affect what's going on inside?",T,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"By the weather changing the molecules, like, I dunno, like, maybe the steam cooled down.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so if the steam cooled down what would happen to it?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,It wouldn't move as fast. It would slow down and maybe go back into liquid form.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so maybe if that happened in there, how is that different than what you showed me?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Because it got water in it now.,F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, why don't you draw that. So why would water in the bottom of this tank make it-",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,"So you know how steam is, when you have steam, something like, it turns into a little liquid. So I think all those air molecules, after they exploded, they turned into liquid at the bottom.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so we have the liquid here at the bottom. And so, how is the liquid here on the bottom different from the liquid you showed me here?",F,Questioning and prompting,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Because the molecules are moving slower.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,It's a different phase.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok. And so how could that allow the can to get crushed? Take a guess here.,F,Questioning and Prompting ,Getting Students Hypothesizing ,,Explore
,[Bot]:,"So, like, I'm going to take a funny guess, the molecules, they like, transformed into a molecule foot.",F,,,,
,[You]:,Ok.,F,Providing Feedback ,,,?
,[Bot]:,"And it was so big and so powerful because of the steam and stuff, and it just stompled, and all the pressure just-",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so let's take this imaginary foot and I stomp it on here, and now I try to stomp it on the one with water in it, which one would crush more?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,The one with water in it.,F,,,,
,[You]:,Why?,F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Explain
,[Bot]:,"Because the water's not moving outward, it's not moving as fast, it's not trying to really get out. It's just there.",F,,,,
,[You]:,"Ok, so I think that's a pretty good explanation, but let's imagine what this imaginary big stomping foot is. What is this foot?",F,Questioning and Prompting ,,,Elaborate
,[Bot]:,Air.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So it's air.,F,Giving Explicit Clarification,,,Explore
,[Bot]:,It's air.,F,,,,
,[You]:,So show me that here. And show me that here. And you'll be ready to present.,F,Giving Explicit Instruction,,,Explain
